# ITEM 1. BUSINESS

<a name="19"></a>
# Our Company

Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the graphics processing unit, or GPU, to solve some of the most
complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of
artificial intelligence, or AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming
market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, or VR, high
performance computing, or HPC, and AI.

The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today,
it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing
capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms.
This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots
and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being rapidly adopted
by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and features that would have been impossible with traditional coding.

NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, libraries,
systems, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets
are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and Compute Unified Device
Architecture, or CUDA, as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to
support several multi-billion dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software
stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number of
developers for each of our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our
customers.

Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $15 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding
inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer
graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual computing. With our introduction of the CUDA programming
model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. This
approach significantly accelerates the performance of the most demanding applications in HPC in fields such as
aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, GPUs power the
fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and
associated software have proven to be well suited for deep learning, an approach we believe will power the era of AI.
As the laws of physics have begun to slow down Moore’s Law, we continue to deliver GPU performance improvements
ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.

# Manufacturing

We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.

We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd., Nanya Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.

We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutions.

We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Quanta Computer, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key elements such as the GPU, SOC and memory are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.

# Working Capital

We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platform-by-platform basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. A substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands.

Our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 5% to $7.11 billion at the end of fiscal year 2018 compared with the end of fiscal year 2017.

# Research and Development

We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading accelerated computing technology is essential to our future success. Our research and development strategy is focused on a unified hardware and software architecture. Our products take years to design and bring to market, and we concurrently develop multiple generations of our architecture. Our research and development efforts include software engineering, including efforts related to the development of our CUDA platform, hardware engineering related to our...

As of January 28, 2018, we had 8,191 full-time employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years
2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred research and development expenses of $1.80 billion, $1.46 billion, and $1.33 billion,
respectively.

<a name="64"></a>
# Competition

The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving
industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product
offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry
standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We
believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and
functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our
products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing
competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better
performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or
alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.

A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SOCs,
and accelerated and AI computing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial,
distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological
changes.

Our current competitors include:
- suppliers or licensors of discrete and integrated GPUs and accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets
that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC or accelerated computing functionality as part of their solutions or
platforms, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, ARM Holdings plc, Imagination Technologies Group plc,
Intel Corporation, or Intel, and Xilinx, Inc.; and
- suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and smart devices such
as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Ltd., Intel,
Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, and Texas Instruments Incorporated.

<a name="65"></a>
# Patents and Proprietary Rights

We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure
agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally.
Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from April 2018 to January 2037. We have numerous patents
issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent
applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on
international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign
countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not
protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased
protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether
and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:
- the location in which our products are manufactured;
- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
- the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
- the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.

We have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive
reasons, and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.

# ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an
investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could
harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline,
and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or
reputation.

<a name="82"></a>
# Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners

If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our
revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.
We have created GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming,
Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change,
changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards.
Our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our
existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may
require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We currently devote significant
resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating
history, such as the automotive and datacenter markets, which presents additional risks to our business. We must also
continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas, including customer
service and customer support. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to
change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not
produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new
products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business,
revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our
strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and
ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology
trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit
potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.

Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors
expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new
competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer
superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling
prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have
longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or IP, portfolios and patent
protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be
able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends,
quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and
obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable to
successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to
meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand
for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our
results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may
continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any
of which could negatively affect our financial results.

System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.

Security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses.

Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.

If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.

Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers' perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.

We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business. We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using

independent subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors.
As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer
demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:

- a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to
supply constraints;
- a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or
test capacity for our products;
- a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including
transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as 16nm FinFET, and memory designs such as CoWoS,
needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
- loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or
subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or
change a supplier;
- a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
- delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our
subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.

In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase
manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross
margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design,
which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields
may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will
exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified
until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.

We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new
products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In
the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability
of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our
products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality
from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or
lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our
revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.

For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor.
Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability
to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular
design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could
result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.

Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major
hardware manufacturers and software developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing
industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design
strategies. Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue
as anticipated, if any.

Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs. Our worldwide
operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at
cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks,
terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or
climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant
losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could
require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters,
and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business
operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In
addition, a majority of our current datacenter capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to
natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product
components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic
locations, including Taiwan, China and Korea. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies
in the U.S. or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirements.

trade policies, and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring,
and profitability. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical
infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our operations could be harmed if
manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters,
high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business,
labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries
and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being
consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or
catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of
declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.

If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. In order
to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for
anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does
not materialize. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:

- changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
- changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
- a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
- a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
- our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
- less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
- increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.

The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could
adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last
month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in
response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost
or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly
forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.

Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate
lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers'
orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such
cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a
cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer
relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.

We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business.
We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our
semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the
United States and Other Americas. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United
States and Other Americas. Revenue from sales outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 79%,
80%, and 79% of total revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Additionally, as of January 28, 2018,
approximately 47% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business
subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations, including:

- international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business;
- unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;
- differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
- local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;

If our sales outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.

If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.

To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.

We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.

We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. The risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
- Difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
- Diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
- Assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
- Difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;
- Difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;
- Failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;
- Legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
- Uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
- The need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
- Potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and
- Impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.

Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters

Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.

We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers.

Regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.

We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross-license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.

Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.

Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:

- our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
- our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
- fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies;
- changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;
- our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;
- our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
- product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
- our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;
- supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products;
- inventory write-downs;
- our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners' product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors;
- the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;
- customer bad debt write-offs;
- any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
- unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;

- Changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
- General macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.

Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.

Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.

Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims.

Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.

Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.

Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. We have in the past and may, from time to time, face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and other issues relating to our business on a global basis. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have been in the past, and may be in the future, the target of securities litigation. The laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex, and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or remedy violations of, these regulations. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an

of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of
operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.
Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft
Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may
discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an
interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a
change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding
voting stock. These provisions include the following:

- the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
- the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
- advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
- the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
- a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
- the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders;
- the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.

On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips
and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an
individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of
our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision
and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could
also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to
cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

# ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 26, 2018, we had approximately 314 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sales price for our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market:

| |High|Low|
|---|---|---|
|Fiscal year ending January 27, 2019|$251.97|$204.00|
|Fiscal year ended January 28, 2018|$243.34|$180.58|
|Fiscal year ended January 29, 2017|$119.93|$66.58|

<a name="123"></a>
# Dividend Policy

In November 2017, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.14 per share, or $0.56 on an annual basis, to $0.15 per share, or $0.60 on an annual basis. In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we paid $341 million and $261 million, respectively, in cash dividends to our common shareholders.

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under the program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. In calendar year 2017, based upon our earnings and profits, 100% of our dividend payments were considered to be ordinary dividends. It is possible that a portion of our dividend payments in future calendar years may be considered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

<a name="124"></a>
# Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. In November 2016, the Board authorized an additional $2.00 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020.

Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 251 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $5.5 billion through January 28, 2018. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 28, 2018, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.82 billion through December 2020. For fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we may enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution.

# Transactions Related to our Convertible Notes and Note Hedges

During fiscal year 2018, we issued an aggregate of 33 million shares of our common stock upon settlement of $812 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes submitted for conversion. In connection with these conversions, we exercised a portion of our Note Hedges to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock. The counterparty to the Note Hedges may be deemed an “affiliated purchaser” and may have purchased the shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon this exercise of our option. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and the Note Hedges.

(A) In fiscal year 2016, we began the wind down of our Icera modem operations. As a result, our income from operations
for fiscal year 2016 included $131 million of restructuring and other charges.

(B) In fiscal year 2014, we issued 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.50
billion. The Convertible Notes first became convertible as of February 1, 2016. As of January 28, 2018, the carrying
value of the Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability and the difference between the principal amount
and the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine
equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

(C) In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. Interest
on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017. Refer to Note 11 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information.

(D) In November 2012, we initiated a quarterly dividend payment of $0.075 per share, or $0.30 per share on an annual

# Overview

<a name="145"></a>
# Our Company and Our Businesses

Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of VR, HPC, and AI.

Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive.

While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Tegra processor business revenue was $1.53 billion, up 86% from a year ago. Tegra processor business revenue includes SOC modules for the Nintendo Switch gaming console and development services. Also included was automotive revenue of $558 million, which was up 15% from a year earlier, incorporating infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements for self-driving cars.

Revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

Gross margin for fiscal year 2018 was 59.9%, compared with 58.8% a year earlier, reflecting a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPUs, and the growth of our GPU computing platform for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization, partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel.

Operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 were $2.61 billion, up from $2.13 billion in the previous year. This reflects growth in employees and related costs, as well as investments in growth initiatives, including gaming, AI, and autonomous driving.

We recorded a U.S. tax reform provisional net tax benefit of $133 million associated with the one-time transition tax on our historical foreign earnings and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to the lower corporate tax rate.

Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2018 were $3.05 billion and $4.82, respectively, up 83% and 88%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins.

We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018 through a combination of $909 million in share repurchases and $341 million in quarterly cash dividends. In November 2017, we declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per share from $0.14 per share. For fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.11 billion as of January 28, 2018, compared with $6.80 billion as of January 29, 2017. The increase was primarily related to the increase in operating income.

# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,
first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost
or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions
relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase
commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions,
changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence
because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or
unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer
purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.

The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was
insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and an unfavorable impact of 1.6% in fiscal year 2016. The charges we
took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the write-off of
excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for
those products. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on
forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and
constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our
competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our
products.

Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further
discussion.

<a name="166"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or
refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax
assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences
and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax
benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves
dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and
liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in
accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in
other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income
tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we
determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current
assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial
statements accordingly.

As of January 28, 2018, we had a valuation allowance of $469 million related to state and certain foreign deferred
tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and
potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent
realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as
an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained
upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S.
federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on
the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on
certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019. Refer
to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information specific to accounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the
TCJA.

# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units, GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 28, 2018 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.

We use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. In applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit, the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted. These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The fair values of our GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. As such, even the application of a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value.

Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="170"></a>
# Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased. We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments.

We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 28, 2018. We concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of January 28, 2018.

Refer to Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="171"></a>
# Stock-based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. The number of PSUs and market-based PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the Company’s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year.

Refer to Notes 1 and 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="172"></a>
# Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to

Concentration of Revenue

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 79%, 80%, and 79% of total revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenue for fiscal year 2018. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we had one customer that represented 12% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.

Our overall gross margin was 59.9%, 58.8%, and 56.1% for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. These increases were driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue, and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled $48 million, $62 million, and $112 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $35 million, $51 million, and $32 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, and an unfavorable impact of 1.6% for fiscal year 2016.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:

GPU Business

The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to strong sales of our GeForce gaming GPU products and revenue growth in datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to product mix resulting from increased sales of our gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization GPU products, as well as a continued decrease in sales volumes of lower margin PC OEM products.

Tegra Processor Business

The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to fewer inventory provisions, and the absence of the warranty charge associated with the SHIELD tablet product recall during fiscal year 2016.

Research and Development: Research and development expenses increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and increased 10% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense.

Sales, General and Administrative: Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and increased by 10% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in outside professional fees of $11 million in fiscal year 2018 and $57 million in fiscal year 2017 resulting from the resolution of intellectual property disputes with Samsung and Qualcomm.

Restructuring and Other Charges: In fiscal year 2016, the company began to wind down its Icera modem operations, resulting in $131 million of restructuring and other charges in that year.

# Total Other Income (Expense)

Interest Income and Interest Expense: Interest income increased over the years, with interest income of $69 million, $54 million, and $39 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Interest expense primarily includes coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to various notes issued by the company.

Other, Net: Other, net, consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, investments in non-affiliated companies, losses on early conversions of Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other expense was $22 million and $25 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.

# Income Taxes

The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S.
federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on
the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain
foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019.

The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar
year, we are subject to transitional tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of
33.9%. The change in the statutory tax rate from 35% to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on
the effective tax rate.

We recognized income tax expense of $149 million, $239 million and $129 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and
2016, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 4.7%, 12.5%, and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016,
respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was
primarily due to the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related
to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year
2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in
fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% due primarily
to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom,
where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal
research tax credit, the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018, and excess tax benefits related to
stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was lower than U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% due primarily
to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom,
where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the
U.S. federal research tax credit, favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations, and adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based
compensation in fiscal year 2017.

For fiscal year 2018, we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the TCJA, which were included as
components of income tax expense and reflected in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018. We will continue to
assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on our business and our consolidated financial statements. The final
impact of the TCJA recorded by us may vary materially from the provisional impact recorded due to a number of
uncertainties and factors, including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by U.S. federal and
state tax authorities and the need for further guidance on the income tax accounting.

In addition to the impact on fiscal year 2018, the TCJA also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal
year 2019. While each of these new tax laws is expected to have some impact on our tax expense for fiscal year 2019
and future periods, we expect the provision designed to tax the low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the
most significant impact.

Because of the complexity of the new tax laws on the low-taxed income of certain foreign subsidiaries, we are
continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of related accounting standards. Based on recent
deliberations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, we expect to be allowed to make an accounting
policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future taxable income in the U.S. as a current-period expense when
incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Our selection of an accounting policy
will depend, in part, on our analysis of relevant facts to determine what the expected impact would be under each
method.

Form 10-K for additional information.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|
|Cash and cash equivalents|$4,002|$1,766|
|Marketable securities|$3,106|$5,032|
|Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities|$7,108|$6,798|

| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|January 31, 2016|
|---|---|---|---|
|Net cash provided by operating activities|$3,502|$1,672|$1,175|
|Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities|$1,278|($793)|($400)|
|Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities|($2,544)|$291|($676)|

As of January 28, 2018, we had $7.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $310 million from the end of fiscal year 2017. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions. Our portfolio managers are required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of high-grade investment securities, the diversification of asset types, and certain limits on our portfolio duration.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital.

Cash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to a reduction in purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by the purchase of our previously-financed Santa Clara campus building. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017 increased from fiscal year 2016, primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities.

Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to cash provided from the issuance of $2.00 billion of Notes in fiscal year 2017 as well as higher repayments of Convertible Notes, tax payments related to employee stock plans, share repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal year 2018. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2017 increased from fiscal year 2016, primarily due to the $2.00 billion of Notes issued in September 2016, partially offset by the repayments of Convertible Notes and $1.00 billion of capital return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.

<a name="197"></a>
# Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 28, 2018, and January 29, 2017, we had $7.11 billion and $6.80 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, asset-backed issuers, mortgage-backed securities by government-sponsored enterprises, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A and Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

The recent TCJA that was signed into law in December 2017 subjects U.S. companies to a one-time transition tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our reasonable estimate of the one-time transition tax that resulted from enactment of the TCJA is $401 million, which will be payable in eight annual installments. Accordingly, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the United States as of January 28, 2018, will now be available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

# Capital Return to Shareholders

During fiscal year 2018, we repurchased a total of 6 million shares for $909 million and paid $341 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. As a result, we returned $1.25 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2018.

For fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

<a name="202"></a>

<a name="204"></a>
# Revolving Credit Facility

In fiscal year 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time, up to $575 million. The commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021. The Credit Agreement also permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments and/or commitments to issue letters of credit of up to $425 million, subject to certain conditions. As of January 28, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts and were in compliance with all related covenants under the Credit Agreement.

<a name="205"></a>
# Commercial Paper

In December 2017, we established a commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. Under the program, we can issue up to $575 million in commercial paper. As of January 28, 2018, there was no commercial paper outstanding.

<a name="206"></a>
# Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements

We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.

<a name="207"></a>
# Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In January 2018, we terminated the off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease financing arrangement related to our new Santa Clara campus building and exercised our option to purchase the property for $335 million, which was recorded in Property and equipment, net, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

2. Represents our reasonable estimate of a provisional tax payable amount of $401 million for the one-time transition tax that resulted from enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018, which will be payable in eight annual installments. The first installment of $32 million is classified as a current income tax payable. The installment amounts will be equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025 and 25% in fiscal year 2026. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
3. Represents unrecognized tax benefits of $190 million which consists of $175 million and the related interest and penalties of $15 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 28, 2018. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.
4. Represents the aggregate principal amount of $15 million for the Convertible Notes. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

# ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

<a name="216"></a>
# Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.

As of January 28, 2018, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $14 million.

In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of Convertible Notes which had $15 million in principal amount outstanding as of January 28, 2018. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the Convertible Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="217"></a>
# Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to

currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely,
decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their
prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures
in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected
by a weaker dollar.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our
operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge
relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are
recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.

We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other
income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets
and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

# Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<a name="292"></a>
# Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our Company

Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that the term means only the parent company.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are both 52-week years and fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Revenue Recognition

Product Revenue

We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.

Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor, as we typically find that over 95% of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed, which is substantially close to 100%, and that this percentage varies by program and by customer. We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue, the amount of which typically represents less than 0.5% of total revenue.

Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. MDFs represent monies paid to our
partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our
partners.

Activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage
factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate
of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed.

We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the
time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular
fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly
reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.

<a name="298"></a>
# License and Development Revenue

For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally
recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements,
we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost
required to complete the project. A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss
becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded
as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the
excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue.

For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further
deliverables over the term of the license agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with
consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue.

Royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license
agreements with third parties. We recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and
when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee.

<a name="299"></a>
# Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2018,
2017, and 2016 were $25 million, $17 million, and $30 million, respectively.

<a name="300"></a>
# Rent Expense

We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred, but not
paid.

<a name="301"></a>
# Product Warranties

We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or
replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the
estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited
circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known
warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

<a name="302"></a>
# Stock-based Compensation

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair
value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate
financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value
of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense
for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee
service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We
estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-
Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based
compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures
annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates. If factors change, the compensation expense that we record under these accounting
standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.

<a name="307"></a>
# Restructuring and Other Charges

Our restructuring and other charges include employee severance and related costs, the write-down of assets, and other exit costs. The severance and related costs include one-time termination benefits as well as certain statutory termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoing benefit arrangements. One-time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees, unless employees must provide future service, in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. Ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable. Any contract termination costs are recognized at estimated fair value when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms. Other associated costs are recognized in the period the liability is incurred. Our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $131 million of restructuring and other charges related to the wind-down of our Icera operations, which was comprised mainly of employee severance, facilities, and related costs. Restructuring charges were not significant for fiscal years 2018 and 2017.

<a name="308"></a>
# Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

<a name="309"></a>
# Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.

<a name="310"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 28, 2018, we had a valuation allowance of $469 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changes U.S. tax law including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019. Refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

<a name="316"></a>
# Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other comprehensive income or loss components include unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges.

<a name="317"></a>
# Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Additionally, we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us, upon conversion, to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock. Our convertible notes, note hedges, and related warrants contain various conversion features, which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stock method will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive. However, unless actually exercised, the note hedges were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share, as their pre-exercised effect would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.

<a name="318"></a>
# Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $4.00 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively, including $3.79 billion and $321 million, respectively, invested in money market funds.

<a name="319"></a>
# Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Credit Loss, we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the
amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other
factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their
fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017. Marketable securities
are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses
included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair
value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized
as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as
fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting
losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow
hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other
comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in
earnings.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable, note hedge and interest rate swap. Our investment policy requires the
purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our
portfolio duration. All marketable securities are held in our name, managed by several investment managers and held
by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those
representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, aggregated approximately 28% of our accounts receivable
balance from two customers as of January 28, 2018 and 29% of our account receivable balance from two customers
as of January 29, 2017. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an
allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an
amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit
insurance and letters of credit.

Accounts Receivable

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer
issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of
gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit
insurance or letters of credit.

Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,
first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including
wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead
associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory
products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to
the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory
provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product
purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has
been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line
method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for
retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or
loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the

Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.

For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred, where potential impairment indicators exist, or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently, we perform a quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment. It tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value-based test by weighting the results from the income approach and the market approach. Refer to Note 4 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update which requires the recognition of income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. We elected to early adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 30, 2017. Upon adoption of this guidance, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the first day of fiscal year 2018 to decrease retained earnings by $28 million, with a corresponding decrease to prepaid taxes that had not been previously recognized in income tax expense.

In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment. The update eliminates the second step in the goodwill impairment test that requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, an entity should recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and applied it prospectively, as permitted by the standard. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019. We anticipate the adoption of this accounting standard to increase the volatility of our other income or expense, net, due to the remeasurement of certain of our equity securities, primarily our investments in non-affiliates, for fair value changes.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of more than 12 months. The update will require additional disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements. Under existing guidance, operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements. However, we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries. We expect to adopt this guidance beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. We have made progress in, and continue to assess changes in policies, processes, systems and controls necessary to meet the additional requirements of the guidance. While we are still finalizing our analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new revenue standard, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, we do expect to provide additional disclosure under this guidance, including more information regarding estimates and judgments, practical expedients used, contract balances and performance obligations.

# Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.

Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized as inventory, as follows:

**Stock-Based Compensation Expense**
| |Year Ended January 28, 2018|Year Ended January 29, 2017|Year Ended January 31, 2016|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cost of revenue|$21 million|$15 million|$15 million|
|Research and development|$219 million|$134 million|$115 million|
|Sales, general and administrative|$151 million|$98 million|$74 million|
|Total|$391 million|$247 million|$204 million|

Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Beginning fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. As of January 28, 2018, there were 5 million stock options outstanding, and the amount of unvested stock options was not significant. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Company’s level of achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee at the beginning of each fiscal year.

Of the total fair value of equity awards, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $156 million, $98 million, and $46 million, respectively.

**Aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense**
| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|
|Aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense|$1,091 million|$627 million|

Estimated weighted average remaining amortization period (in years):

- RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs: 2.3 (2018), 2.6 (2017)
- ESPP: 0.7 (2018), 0.6 (2017)

<a name="342"></a>
# ESPP Fair Value Assumptions

**ESPP Fair Value Assumptions**
| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|January 31, 2016|
|---|---|---|---|
|Weighted average expected life (in years)|0.5-2.0|0.5-2.0|0.5-2.0|
|Risk-free interest rate|0.8%-1.4%|0.5%-0.9%|0.1%-0.7%|
|Volatility|40%-54%|30%-39%|24%-34%|
|Dividend yield|0.3%-0.5%|0.7%-1.4%|1.5%-1.8%|

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.

Additionally, for employee stock option, RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.

# Equity Incentive Program

We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans.

<a name="344"></a>
# Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.

The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors, and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 207 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs.

PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 28, 2018, there were 16 million shares available for future issuance.

Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grants made prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5% vesting semi-annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016, 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.

Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment.

Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Up to 75 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 28, 2018, we had issued 28 million shares and reserved 47 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months.

Employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an offering may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld up to certain limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15%. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. Employees may end their participation in the 2012 Plan at any time during the offering period, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with us. In each case, the employee’s contributions are refunded.

# Net Income Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

| |Year Ended| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|January 31, 2016| |
|Numerator: Net income|$3,047|$1,666|$614| |

|Dilutive impact of outstanding securities:| | | | |
|Equity awards|24|26|13| |

|Warrants issued with the 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes|4|38|—| |
|Diluted weighted average shares|632|649|569| |

Net income per share:

- Basic (1): $5.09, $3.08, $1.13
- Diluted (2): $4.82, $2.57, $1.08

Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive: 4, 8, 10

(1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.

(2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.

The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting.

Exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.0350 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or
the Warrants, outstanding are also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. As of January 28, 2018,
there were no warrants outstanding.

For fiscal year 2018, our average stock price was $158.35, which exceeded both the adjusted conversion price and the
adjusted strike price, causing the Convertible Notes and the Warrants to have a dilutive impact.

The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge
transactions, or the Note Hedges, that we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, as its
effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the Convertible Notes, the shares delivered to us under the
Note Hedges will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the Convertible Notes.

Refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the
Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants.

# Note 4 - Goodwill

The carrying amount of goodwill is from the following acquisitions:

|Acquisition|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|
|Icera|$271|$271|
|PortalPlayer|$105|$105|
|Mental Images|$59|$59|
|3dfx|$50|$50|
|MediaQ|$35|$35|
|ULi|$31|$31|
|Other|$67|$67|
|Total goodwill|$618|$618|

The amount of goodwill allocated to our GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units was $210 million and $408 million,
respectively, as of both January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017. Refer to Note 16 of these Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion regarding segments.

We completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and concluded that there was no
impairment, as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. The fair value was determined by
weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach.

These income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to,
prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly
traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry
economic factors and the future profitability of our business. When performing an income approach valuation, we
incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant
based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model. Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon,
among other things, certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance, such as revenue growth
rates, operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. The market method
of determining the fair value of our reporting units requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market
comparables.

The following table provides the breakdown of unrealized losses as of January 28, 2018, aggregated by investment
category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position:

|Fair Value|Less than 12 Months Gross Unrealized Losses|Fair Value|12 Months or Greater Gross Unrealized Losses|Fair Value|Total Gross Unrealized Losses|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|$433|($2)|$801|($7)|$1,234|($9)|
|$175|($1)|$640|($6)|$815|($7)|
|$170|($1)|$404|($3)|$574|($4)|

|$0|$0|$41|($1)|$41|($1)|
|$851|($4)|$2,065|($19)|$2,916|($23)|

The gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities and were primarily due to changes in interest rates,
which we believe are temporary in nature. Currently, we have the intent and ability to hold our investments until
maturity. For fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, there were no other-than-temporary impairment losses and net
realized gains were not significant.

# Note 7 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.

We classify securities within Level 1 when the fair value is obtained from real-time quotes in active markets involving identical securities. We classify securities within Level 2 when pricing is obtained from real-time quotes of similar securities in active markets or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.

There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for fiscal year 2018. Level 3 assets are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances.

We did not have any securities classified as Level 3 as of January 28, 2018.

|Pricing Category|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|
|Assets| | |
|Money market funds|Level 1 - $3,789|Level 1 - $321|
|Corporate debt securities|Level 2 - $1,295|Level 2 - $2,388|
|Debt securities of U.S. government agencies|Level 2 - $815|Level 2 - $1,188|

(1) These liabilities are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their original issuance value, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, and are not marked to fair value each period. Refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(2) In January 2018, we terminated the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 9 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

# Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments

In fiscal year 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new Santa Clara campus building. In January 2018, we terminated the operating lease financing arrangement and purchased the property. Concurrently, the related interest rate swap was terminated.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017.

# (Continued)

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017:

| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|
|Designated as cash flow hedges|$104 million|$67 million|
|Not designated for hedge accounting|$94 million|$32 million|

As of January 28, 2018, the maturities of the designated foreign currency forward contracts were three months or less. We expect to realize all gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to these foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months.

During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

<a name="397"></a>
# Note 10 - Guarantees

U.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a tabular reconciliation of the changes of the entity’s product warranty liabilities.

<a name="398"></a>
# Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities

We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 are as follows:

| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|
|Balance at beginning of period|$8 million|$11 million|
|Additions|$14 million|$2 million|
|Deductions|($7) million|($5) million|
|Balance at end of period|$15 million|$8 million|

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered into in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

# Long-Term Debt

2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026

In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due
2026, collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning
on March 16, 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity,
at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-
whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of
the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting
debt discount and issuance costs.

The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our
subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

| |Expected Remaining Term (years)|Effective Interest Rate|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|2.20% Notes Due 2021|3.6|2.38%|$1,000|$1,000|
|3.20% Notes Due 2026|8.6|3.31%|$1,000|$1,000|

# Convertible Debt

1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018

In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. Through January 28, 2018,
we had settled an aggregate of $1.48 billion of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are unsecured,
unsubordinated obligations of the Company paying interest in cash semi-annually at a rate of 1.00% per annum and
will mature on December 1, 2018 unless previously repurchased or converted. Upon conversion, we pay cash up to the
aggregate principal amount and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our
election, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount being converted.

Holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time prior to August 1, 2018 under certain
circumstances. For example, during any fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20
trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day, the Convertible
Notes become convertible at the holders' option. As this condition has been met, all outstanding Convertible Notes are
convertible at the holders’ option through April 29, 2018.

During fiscal year 2018, we paid cash to settle $812 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and had $15
million in principal amount outstanding as of January 28, 2018. We also issued 33 million shares of our common stock
for the excess conversion value and recognized a loss of $19 million on early conversions of the Convertible Notes.
Based on the closing price of our common stock of $243.33 on the last trading day of fiscal year 2018, the if-converted
value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $174 million.
As of January 28, 2018, the conversion rate was 49.9127 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the
Convertible Notes (equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of $20.0350 per share of common stock).

We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes as our conversion obligation
in excess of the aggregate principal could be fully or partially settled in cash. The liability component was assigned by

The fair value of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and the
liability component was assigned as the equity component. The initial liability component of the Convertible Notes was
valued at $1.35 billion and the initial carrying value of the equity component recorded in additional paid-in-capital was
valued at $126 million. This equity component, together with the $23 million purchaser's discount to the par value of the
Convertible Notes, represented the initial aggregate unamortized debt discount of $148 million. The debt discount is
amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method
and an interest rate of 3.15%.

As of January 28, 2018, the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability and the
difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as convertible
debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The convertible debt
conversion obligation as of January 28, 2018 was not significant.

**Carrying Value of the Convertible Notes**
| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|
|1.00% Convertible Senior Notes|$15|$827|
|Unamortized debt discount (1)|—|($31)|
|Net carrying amount|$15|$796|

(1) As of January 28, 2018, the balance of unamortized debt discount was not significant and will be fully amortized in
fiscal year 2019.

**Interest Expense for Convertible Notes**
| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|January 31, 2016|
|---|---|---|---|
|Contractual coupon interest expense|$—|$9|$15|
|Amortization of debt discount|$2|$24|$29|
|Total interest expense related to Convertible Notes|$2|$33|$44|

Note Hedges and Warrants

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction, or the
Note Hedges. The Note Hedges have an adjusted strike price of $20.0350 per share and allow us to receive shares of
our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver and/or pay, respectively, to
the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion. Through January 28, 2018, we had received 56 million shares of
our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.48 billion in
principal amount of the Convertible Notes.

In addition, concurrent with the offering of the Convertible Notes and the purchase of the Note Hedges, we entered into
a separate warrant transaction, or the Warrants. In fiscal year 2017, we entered into an agreement to terminate 63
million warrants and delivered a total of 48 million shares of common stock. In fiscal year 2018, we entered into a
second agreement to terminate the remaining 12 million warrants outstanding and delivered a total of 10 million shares
of common stock. Therefore, no warrants were outstanding as of January 28, 2018.

Revolving Credit Facility

In fiscal year 2017, we entered into a credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, under which we may borrow, repay
and re-borrow amounts from time to time, up to $575 million, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
The commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021. The Credit
Agreement also permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments up to $425 million, subject to certain
conditions. As of

# Legal Proceedings (Continued)

Against NVIDIA. On September 14, 2016, NVIDIA answered the Polaris Complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the six Polaris patents.

On December 5, 2016, the Texas Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to transfer and ordered the case transferred to the Northern District of California.

Between December 7, 2016 and July 25, 2017, NVIDIA led multiple petitions for inter partes review, or IPR, at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the U.S. litigation. The USPTO instituted IPRs for U.S. Patent Nos. 6,532,505; 7,405,993; 7,886,122; and 8,161,344. The USPTO declined to institute IPRs on U.S. Patent Nos. 7,124,325 and 8,207,976.

On June 15, 2017, the California Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the district court litigation pending resolution of the petitions for IPR. The California Court has not set a trial date.

On December 30, 2016, Polaris filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf, Germany. Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe three patents relating to control of DRAM: European Patent No. EP1428225, and German Patent Nos. DE 10223167 and DE 1020066043668. On July 14, 2017, NVIDIA filed defenses to the infringement allegations including non-infringement with respect to each of the three asserted patents.

An oral hearing is scheduled for February 21, 2019.

Between March 31, 2017 and June 12, 2017, NVIDIA filed nullity actions with the German Patent Court challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the German litigation.

The income tax expense differs from the amount computed by applying the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 and U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 to income before income taxes as follows:

| |Year Ended|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|January 31, 2016|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Tax expense computed at federal statutory rate| |$1,084|$667|$260|
|Expense (benefit) resulting from:| | | | |
|State income taxes, net of federal tax effect| |10|4|1|
|Foreign tax rate differential| |($545)|($315)|($95)|
|Stock-based compensation (1)| |($181)|($70)|$13|
|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2)| |($133)|—|—|
|U.S. federal R&D tax credit| |($87)|($52)|($38)|
|Tax expense related to intercompany transaction| |—|10|10|
|Restructuring and expiration of statute of limitations| |—|—|($21)|
|Other| |1|($5)|($1)|
|Income tax expense| |$149|$239|$129|

(1) We adopted an accounting standard related to stock-based compensation effective February 1, 2016, which required the excess tax benefit to be reflected in our provision for income taxes rather than in additional paid-in-capital. The total related excess tax benefit recognized for fiscal year 2018 and 2017 was $197 million and $82 million, respectively.

(2) We recognized a provisional tax benefit of $133 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense.

The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:

| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|
|Deferred tax assets:| | |
|Net operating loss carryforwards|$67|$199|
|Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes|$24|$40|
|Property, equipment and intangible assets|$32|$50|
|Research and other tax credit carryforwards|$579|$728|
|Stock-based compensation|$24|$34|
|Convertible debt|$0|$6|
|Gross deferred tax assets|$726|$1,057|
|Less valuation allowance|($469)|($353)|

|Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries|($26)|($827)|
|Gross deferred tax liabilities|($30)|($838)|
|Net deferred tax asset (liability)|$227|($134)|

We recognized income tax expense of $149 million, $239 million, and $129 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 4.7%, 12.5%, and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

In December 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on

The earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019.

The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject to transitional tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 33.9%. The change in the statutory tax rate from 35% to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate.

U.S. GAAP requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC also issued guidance that allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to exceed one year. Accordingly, as of January 28, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax benefit of $133 million as a component of income tax expense, which is our reasonable estimate of the effects of the tax law changes on existing deferred tax balances and the calculation of the one-time transition tax.

The one-time transition tax is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits, or E&P, of our foreign subsidiaries. We had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of these same earnings. We recorded a provisional one-time transition tax liability of $971 million and released the previously accrued deferred tax liabilities of $1.15 billion, resulting in a net decrease to income tax expense of $176 million.

We have reasonably estimated, but not yet completed, the calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for our foreign subsidiaries. Our calculation of the transition tax may change with further analysis, additional guidance from the U.S. federal and state tax authorities and additional guidance for the associated income tax accounting.

As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. As a result, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $43 million on the write-down of our deferred tax balance.

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit, the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was lower than U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the U.S. federal research tax credit, favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations, and adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2017.

As of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, we had a valuation allowance of $469 million and $353 million, respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

As of January 28, 2018, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $74 million, $226 million and $281 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2023 and 2019, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $281 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 28, 2018, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $361 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2032. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $575 million, of which $554 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $21 million is attributable to various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal year 2019. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances.

Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to
limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state
and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.

As of January 28, 2018, we had $447 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $413 million would affect our
effective tax rate if recognized. However, approximately $58 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to
state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that
would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $413 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 28, 2018
consisted of $175 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $238 million reflected as a reduction to the
related deferred tax assets.

<a name="455"></a>
# A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

| |January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|January 31, 2016|
|---|---|---|---|
|Balance at beginning of period|$224|$230|$254|
|Increases in tax positions for prior years|7|3|—|
|Decreases in tax positions for prior years|(1)|—|(1)|
|Increases in tax positions for current year|222|46|28|
|Settlements|—|(48)|—|
|Lapse in statute of limitations|(5)|(7)|(51)|
|Balance at end of period|$447|$224|$230|

The increase in the unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the one-time transition tax imposed
on foreign earnings under the TCJA. We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount
refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is
classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate
payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.

Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense. As of January 28, 2018, January 29, 2017, and January 31, 2016, we had accrued $15 million, $13 million,
and $11 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not
included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 28, 2018, unrecognized tax benefits of $175
million and the related interest and penalties of $15 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be
greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to
be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise
resolved. As of January 28, 2018, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions
will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

We are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States and throughout the world. As of
January 28, 2018, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong
Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2017. As of January 28, 2018,
the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include India, Taiwan, UK, and Germany
for fiscal years 2003 through 2017.

# Note 15 - Employee Retirement Plans

We have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all of our United States employees. Under the plan, participating employees may defer up to 80% of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits and we match a portion of the employee contributions. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $23 million, $12 million, and $8 million, respectively. We also have defined contribution retirement plans outside of the United States to which we contributed $25 million, $23 million, and $21 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

<a name="465"></a>
# Note 16 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.

We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying graphics architecture.

While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.

Under the single unifying graphics architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most.

The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

# Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “goal,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “potential” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance, time frames or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, time frames or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in greater detail under the heading “Risk Factors.” Given these risks, uncertainties and other factors, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this filing. You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We hereby qualify our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

Our Company

Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the graphics processing unit, or GPU, to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence, or AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, or VR, high performance computing, or HPC, and AI.

The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning continues to be adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and features that would have been impossible with traditional coding.

NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and Compute Unified Device Architecture, or CUDA, as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.

Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $17 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual computing. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the performance of the most demanding applications in HPC in fields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs power the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software have proven to be well suited for deep learning and are now expanding into machine learning, powering the era of AI. As the laws of physics have begun to slow down Moore’s Law, we continue to deliver GPU performance improvements ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.

We serve the Professional Visualization market by working closely with independent software vendors to optimize their offerings for NVIDIA GPUs. Our GPU computing solutions enhance productivity and introduce new capabilities for critical parts of the workflow for such major industries as automotive, media and entertainment, architectural engineering, oil and gas, and medical imaging.

Designers who build the products we use every day need the images that they view digitally to mirror reality. This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering, an emerging trend in professional design. Our DesignWorks software delivers this to designers and enables an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. It also allows an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.

Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise applications, including within medicine, architecture, product design, and retail. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life all deploy this technology, powered by our GPUs.

Visual computing is vital to productivity in many environments, including design and manufacturing and digital content creation. Design and manufacturing includes computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video editing and post production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics.

Our brand for this market is Quadro for workstations. Quadro GPUs enhance the productivity of designers by improving performance and adding functionality, such as photorealistic rendering, high color fidelity, and advanced scalable display capabilities. During fiscal year 2019, we introduced the NVIDIA RTX platform, making it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and environments with physically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time.

Datacenter

The NVIDIA accelerated computing platform addresses AI and HPC applications. The platform consists of our energy efficient GPUs, our CUDA programming language, specific libraries such as cuDNN and TensorRT, and innovations such as NVLink, which enables application scalability across multiple GPUs.

In the field of AI, NVIDIA’s platform accelerates both deep learning and machine learning workloads. Deep learning is a computer science approach where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data in the form of images, sounds and text - in some instances better than humans. Machine learning is a related approach that leverages algorithms as well as data to learn how to make determinations or predictions, often used in data science. HPC, also referred to as scientific computing, uses numerical computational approaches to solve large and complex problems. For both AI and HPC applications, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform greatly increases the performance and power efficiency of high-performance computers and datacenters, as GPUs excel at parallel workloads. For example, an NVIDIA GPU-accelerated machine learning cluster for data science is 1/8 the cost, 1/15 the space, and 1/18 the power of a traditional CPU-based cluster.

We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such as reading medical images, to enabling fraud detection in financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling. These organizations include the world’s leading cloud services companies such as Amazon, Baidu, and Facebook, which are infusing AI in applications that enable highly accurate voice recognition and real-time translation; enterprises that are increasingly turning to AI to improve products and services; and startups seeking to implement AI in transformative ways across multiple industries.

# # NVIDIA Corporation - Quarterly Report

<a name="538"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 9

for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our GPU
and CUDA platforms. We now have over 700 thousand registered developers across our platforms, including accelerated computing,
gaming, deep learning, autonomous machines, and others.

As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms and
complete systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our
platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.

<a name="539"></a>
# Backlog

Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our
shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability.
Our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules, thus, we believe that only a small portion of our
backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.

<a name="540"></a>
# Seasonality

Our GPU and Tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and
cloud service provider datacenters, although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry. Our consumer products have
typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue; for
example, in fiscal year 2019 second half revenue was weaker than the first half.

<a name="541"></a>
# Manufacturing

We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we
employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging.
This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such
areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant
costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used
in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the
majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional
quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.

We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co.
Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering,
Inc., Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd.,
and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms.
We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and
memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.

We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration, and then
ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party
warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications,
and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutions.

We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and ODMs such as
Quanta Computer and Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key
elements such as the GPU, SOC and memory are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other
components used in the production process.

<a name="542"></a>
# Working Capital

We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by
communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platform-by-platform
basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial
inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. A
substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors
to balance our customer demands.

# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 10

Our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 4% to $7.42 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019 compared with the end of fiscal year 2018.

<a name="545"></a>
# Competition

The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.

A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SOCs, and accelerated and AI computing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.

Our current competitors include:

- Suppliers or licensors of discrete and integrated GPUs and accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC or accelerated computing functionality as part of their solutions or platforms, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, or Intel, and Xilinx, Inc.; and
- Suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, Texas Instruments Incorporated, and Xilinx Inc.

<a name="546"></a>
# Patents and Proprietary Rights

We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2019 to February 2038. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:

- The location in which our products are manufactured;
- Our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
- The degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
- The commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.

We have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons, and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.

# Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners

If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted. We have created GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We currently devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and datacenter markets, which presents additional risks to our business. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas, including customer service and customer support. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.

Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue. Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or IP, portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.

System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation. Security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may

create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software
programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where
we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management
and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience
breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means,
such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those
of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in
increased expenses.

Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of
proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the
parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory
inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these
challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and
loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical
functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results,
stock price and reputation.

If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could
be damaged, and we could lose market share.

Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to
any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products
are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are
released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by
customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or
end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs
that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to
substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs,
ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant
warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the
attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect
in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve
market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our
brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the
field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns
could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors
and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the
claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our
business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact
our financial results.

We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces
our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule
and could harm our business.

We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility.
Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung
Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not
directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment
contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on
our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results,
including:

- a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply
constraints;
- a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our
products;

# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Report

<a name="563"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 14

• a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to
smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture
our products profitably or on a timely basis;

• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and
commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;

• a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and

• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or
foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.

In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs,
harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results.
Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which
typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know
whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified
until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.

We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product
enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced
delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully
simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for
more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we
miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our
revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.

For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. Achieving design wins
may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that
customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent
generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection
processes.

Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware
manufacturers and software developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety
standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Winning a product design does not guarantee
sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.

Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud
service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical
epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these
disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any
of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate
headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations,
finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In
addition, a large portion of our current datacenter capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters
or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our
products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, and Korea. Geopolitical
change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad also may result in changing regulatory
requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access
to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result
in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other
retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control
Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party
vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our operations
---

<a name="565"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 15

could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters,
high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental,
public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general
infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event
a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be
harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.

If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. We sell many of our
products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the
decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand
for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our
customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that
does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. Such decisions may and have resulted in
prolonged channel sell-through, as we experienced with our mid-range gaming GPUs in fiscal year 2019. In estimating demand, we make
multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:

- changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
- changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
- a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
- a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
- our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
- less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
- increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.

The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our
gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be
able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be
required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in
average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.

Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or
capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may
also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels
to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on
a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could
be damaged.

We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business.
We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductor wafers
are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States. We also generate a significant
portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the
products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue
from sales outside of the United States accounted for 87% of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017. Revenue from
billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 24% of our revenue for fiscal year 2019, even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end
customers that are located in a different location. Additionally, as of January 27, 2019, approximately 46% of our employees were located
outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:

- international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European
Union, and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;
- unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;
- differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;

• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are
prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;

• exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other
trade barriers and restrictions;

• disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and

• increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.

If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.

If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.

To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.

We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.

We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. The risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:

- difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
- diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
- assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
- difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;
- difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;
- failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;
- legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
- uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
- the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
- potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company;
- impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.

# Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters

Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.

We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.

Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:
- our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
- our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
- fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies;
- changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;
- our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;
- our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
- product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
- our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;
- supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products;
- inventory write-downs;

• our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors;

• the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;

• customer bad debt write-offs;

• any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;

• unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;

• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and

• general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.

Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.

Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.

Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims.

Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.

As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.

Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.

Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations, and regulatory proceedings. We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative, and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands, and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition, and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. For example, multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. In addition, a stockholder, purporting to act on behalf of the Company, filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the Company against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.

In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex, and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or remedy violations of, these regulations.

Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:

- the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
- the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
- advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
- the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
- a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
- the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders;
- the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.

On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

# Overview

Our Company and Our Businesses

Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of VR, HPC, and AI.

Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

# Fiscal Year 2019 Summary

| |Year Ended January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|Change|
|---|---|---|---|
|Revenue|$11,716|$9,714|Up 21%|
|Gross margin|61.2%|59.9%|Up 130 bps|
|Operating expenses|$3,367|$2,612|Up 29%|
|Income from operations|$3,804|$3,210|Up 19%|
|Net income|$4,141|$3,047|Up 36%|
|Net income per diluted share|$6.63|$4.82|Up 38%|

Revenue for fiscal year 2019 increased 21% year over year, reflecting growth in each of our market platforms - gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. GPU business revenue was $10.17 billion, up 25% from a year earlier. Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes automotive, SOC modules for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $1.54 billion, up slightly from a year ago.

Gaming revenue was $6.25 billion, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in gaming GPUs. Gaming GPU growth was fueled by Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our Max-Q technology. We experienced significant volatility in our Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2019. We believe demand for our desktop gaming GPU products used by end users for cryptocurrency mining and its after-effects have distorted trends in Gaming revenue. We also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China have impacted consumer demand for our GeForce gaming GPU products. In addition, sales of certain high-end GeForce gaming GPUs using our new Turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. As a result, during a portion of fiscal year 2019, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory. For fiscal year 2020, we expect our Gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019, with expected growth from sales of Turing-based GPU products and notebook GPU products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previously-noted factors.

Professional visualization revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% from a year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products.

Datacenter revenue was $2.93 billion, up 52% from a year ago, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems. Toward the end of fiscal year 2019, we believe that customers across broad-based vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty, and a number of

# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 25

Datacenter deals did not close. While we believe the pause is temporary, our visibility remains relatively low and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in the Datacenter market until later in fiscal year 2020.

Automotive revenue of $641 million was up 15% from a year earlier, driven by infotainment modules, production DRIVE platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies.

OEM and IP revenue was $767 million, down 1% from a year ago, driven by the absence of Intel licensing revenue, which concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $306 million and $273 million, respectively. We expect revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products to be negligible going forward.

Gross margin for fiscal year 2019 was 61.2%, compared with 59.9% a year earlier, which reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips.

Operating expenses for fiscal year 2019 were $3.37 billion, up 29% from a year earlier, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs.

Income from operations for fiscal year 2019 was $3.80 billion, up 19% from a year earlier. Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2019 were $4.14 billion and $6.63, respectively, up 36% and 38%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled primarily by revenue growth and improved gross margin, as well as the impact of the U.S. tax reform benefit.

During fiscal year 2019, we returned $1.95 billion to shareholders through a combination of $1.58 billion in share repurchases and $371 million in quarterly cash dividends. We intend to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million of share repurchases we made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.42 billion as of January 27, 2019, compared with $7.11 billion as of January 28, 2018. The increase was primarily related to the increase in net income, partially offset by changes in working capital and the increases in stock repurchases, dividends and taxes paid related to restricted stock units.

GPU Business

During fiscal year 2019, for gaming, we announced NVIDIA RTX - a computer graphics technology using our Turing architecture that produces movie-quality images in real time using ray tracing and AI. During the year, we released many new GeForce RTX desktop gaming GPU products, including RTX 2080Ti, 2080, 2070 and 2060, as well as many new Max-Q GeForce gaming notebook GPU products - the most recent of which are powered by RTX GPUs.

For our professional visualization platform, we announced the Quadro GV100 GPU with RTX technology, making real-time ray tracing possible on professional design and content creation applications. We also unveiled the Quadro RTX series, which is designed to revolutionize the workflow of designers and artists on the desktop, and announced the NVIDIA CUDA-accelerated REDCODE RAW decode SDK, enabling developers and studios to edit 8K video.

For our datacenter platform, we unveiled many advances to our deep learning computing platform - including NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with 32GB memory, NVIDIA NVSwitch GPU interconnect fabric, the NVIDIA DGX-2 and HGX-2 for AI and HPC, the NVIDIA RTX Server, and TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software. In addition, we introduced RAPIDS, an open-source GPU-acceleration platform for data science and machine learning, launched the NVIDIA T4 cloud GPU and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Inference Platform for advanced acceleration in hyperscale datacenters, announced GPU acceleration for Kubernetes to facilitate enterprise inference deployment on multi-cloud GPU clusters, and announced that five of the world’s seven fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA GPUs.

Tegra Processor Business

During fiscal year 2019, for the automotive market, we introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE AutoPilot Level 2+ automated driving system, announced NVIDIA DRIVE AGX design wins with Toyota, Volvo Cars and Isuzu Motors, and announced that Daimler and Bosch have selected NVIDIA’s DRIVE platform to bring automated and driverless vehicles to city streets. We also began production of our Xavier single-chip autopilot SOC, started shipping the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier developer kit, and introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation server with DRIVE Sim software to safely test drive autonomous vehicles over billions of miles in virtual reality by leveraging NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA DRIVE Pegasus. In addition, we launched the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier module to help build the next-generation of autonomous machines and announced that Yamaha Motor Co. will use NVIDIA to power its upcoming lineup of autonomous machines.

# Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

<a name="607"></a>
# Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

<a name="608"></a>
# Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

<a name="609"></a>
# License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

<a name="610"></a>
# Software Licensing

Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.

Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,
first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or
net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to
the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments
compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in
market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing
technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing
actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding
excess inventory.

The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an
unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. The higher amount of
charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM,
other components, and prior architecture components and chips, whereas the charges we took during fiscal years 2018 and
2017 were primarily related to the write-off of excess quantities of GPU and Tegra products whose inventory levels were
higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make
commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our
third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings
and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact
demand for our products.

Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further
discussion.

Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable
in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as
appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a
valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and
judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,
in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United
States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize
liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax
liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax
expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 27, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $562 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets
that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization
limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax
assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit
based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal
corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed
income, or GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to
impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. The
SEC had provided guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (SAB 118), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year.

from the enactment date. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the
TCJA and elected to account for GILTI in deferred taxes. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part
IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information specific to accounting for income taxes and the impacts from
the enactment of the TCJA.

# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment
exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting
unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units, GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes
of completing our goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 27, 2019 was $210
million and $408 million, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use
of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our
reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently
uncertain.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we used the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit
and concluded there was no impairment.

Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information.

<a name="616"></a>
# Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or
less at the time of acquisition. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities greater than three months
when purchased. We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets are
determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. All of our
available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair
value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments.

We performed an impairment review of our debt investment portfolio as of January 27, 2019. We concluded that our debt investments
were appropriately valued and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale
debt investments as of January 27, 2019.

Refer to Notes 7 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information.

<a name="617"></a>
# Stock-based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our
corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs,
and our employee stock purchase plan. The number of PSUs and market-based PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the
Company’s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee
in the beginning of each fiscal year.

Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information.

<a name="618"></a>
# Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current
litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that
these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If
that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes
available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can
reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual
liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional
costs.

GPU Business. GPU business revenue increased by 25% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. This increase was due primarily to 18% growth in sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming, driven by initial sales of Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our Max-Q technology. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 52%, reflecting strong sales of our Volta architecture products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 21% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products. Our PC OEM revenue decreased by 1% driven by the absence of Intel licensing revenue in fiscal year 2019. Revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $306 million and $273 million, respectively. We expect cryptocurrency-related revenue to be negligible going forward.

GPU business revenue increased by 40% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 led by growth in gaming, datacenter and professional visualization. Revenue from sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 20%, reflecting continued strong demand for our Pascal-based GPU products. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 133%, reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated GPU computing as well as demand for HPC, DGX AI supercomputing and GRID virtualization platforms. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 12% due primarily to higher sales in both high-end desktop and mobile.

workstation products. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs increased by over 90% due primarily to strong
demand for GPU products targeted for cryptocurrency mining.

<a name="626"></a>
# Tegra Processor Business

Tegra Processor business revenue was up slightly in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. This
was driven by an increase of over 15% in automotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and
development agreements with automotive companies, offset by a decline of approximately 15% in SOC modules for gaming platforms
and related development services.

Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 86% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. This was driven by an increase
of over 300% in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms and development services, and an increase of 15% in automotive
revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements for self-driving cars.

<a name="627"></a>
# All Other

Our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2018, we recognized
related revenue of $43 million, down from $264 million for fiscal year 2017.

<a name="628"></a>
# Concentration of Revenue

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 87% of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019, 2018,
and 2017. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed
even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. In fiscal year 2017, we had one customer
that represented 12% of our total revenue.

<a name="629"></a>
# Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of
semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs,
manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty
provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service
arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.

Our overall gross margin was 61.2%, 59.9%, and 58.8% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in fiscal
year 2019 reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million
in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million
we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips. The increase in fiscal year
2018 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue, and the growth of our datacenter
revenue for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of
our patent license agreement with Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

Inventory provisions totaled $270 million, $48 million, and $62 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Sales of
inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $41 million, $35 million, and $51 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and
2017, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019 and
insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017.

<a name="630"></a>
# GPU Business

The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018,
primarily due to strong sales of high-end GeForce gaming GPUs and revenue growth in Datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and
DGX, for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year
2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to strong sales of our GeForce gaming GPU products and revenue growth in
datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization.

<a name="631"></a>
# Tegra Processor Business

The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared
to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to a favorable mix shift. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal
year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive.

Research and Development: Research and development expenses increased by 32% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 and increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense.

Sales, General and Administrative: Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 22% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 and increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense.

<a name="635"></a>
# Total Other Income (Expense)

Interest Income and Interest Expense: Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Interest income was $136 million, $69 million, and $54 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher rates from our floating rate securities and the purchase of new securities.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $58 million, $61 million, and $58 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

Other, Net: Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, losses on early debt conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments. Other, net, was $22 million and $25 million of expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisting primarily of $19 million and $21 million of losses recognized from early conversions of the Convertible Notes during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Income Taxes: The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes (GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019.

We recognized income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019, and income tax expense of $149 million and $239 million for fiscal years 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was (6.3)%, 4.7%, and 12.5% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higher U.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019.

The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 and 35% for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

In fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the TCJA by applying the SEC guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects. Furthermore, under U.S. GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Because we were still evaluating the GILTI provisions as of January 28, 2018, we recorded no GILTI-related deferred balances. After further evaluation, we elected to account for GILTI deferred taxes. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and recognized a reduction of $368 million to the provisional amount recorded at January 28, 2018, primarily relating to the effects of electing to account for GILTI in deferred taxes.

Cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, due to higher purchases and lower sales
of marketable securities, partially offset by higher maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year
2018 increased from fiscal year 2017, primarily due to a reduction in purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by the purchase
of our previously-financed Santa Clara campus building.

Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, due to higher share repurchases and higher
tax payments related to employee stock plans, partially offset by lower repayments of Convertible Notes. Cash used in financing activities
in fiscal year 2018 increased from fiscal year 2017, primarily due to cash provided from the issuance of $2.00 billion of Notes in fiscal year
2017 as well as higher repayments of Convertible Notes, tax payments related to employee stock plans, share repurchases and dividend
payments in fiscal year 2018.

# Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations.
As of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, we had $7.42 billion and $7.11 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated
corporations and financial institutions, asset-backed issuers, mortgage-backed securities by government-sponsored enterprises, and
foreign government entities. These marketable securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A and Note 7 of the Notes to

# Capital Return to Shareholders

We previously announced our plan to return $1.25 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2019 and an additional $3.00 billion by the end of
fiscal year 2020 - some of which would begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. During fiscal year 2019, we repurchased a total of
9 million shares for $1.58 billion, including $700 million of the $3.00 billion, and paid $371 million in cash dividends.

We intend to return the remaining $2.30 billion of the $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020 through a combination
of share repurchases and cash dividends.

In November 2018, the Board authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program and extended it through the end
of December 2022. As of January 27, 2019, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion.

In November 2018, we also announced a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share from $0.15 per share.

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing
determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. Refer
to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
discussion.

(1) Represents the aggregate principal amount of $2.00 billion and anticipated interest payments of $302 million for the Notes. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(2) Represents our remaining tax payable of the one-time transition tax that resulted from enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018. As of January 27, 2019, we have paid the first installment of $33 million. The remaining will be payable in seven annual installments. The next installment of $33 million is classified as a current income tax payable. The installment amounts are equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025 and 25% in fiscal year 2026. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information about the one-time transition tax.

(3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits of $163 million which consists of $142 million and the related interest and penalties of $21 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 27, 2019. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.

# Investment and Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.

As of January 27, 2019, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $8 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $7 million, respectively.

In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

# # Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

<a name="656"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 35

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.

Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.

We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on their evaluation as of January 27, 2019, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 27, 2019.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

# Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries as of January 27, 2019
and January 28, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended January 27, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in
the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended January 27, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

<a name="698"></a>
# Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

# Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

# Financial Reporting Limitations

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our Company

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 52-week years.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through specific steps outlined.

Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs, and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. Additional details are provided regarding customer programs involving rebates and marketing development funds (MDFs).

# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 48

License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

Software Licensing

Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.

Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $21 million, $25 million, and $17 million, respectively.

Product Warranties

We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Stock-based Compensation

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency

<a name="735"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 27, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $562 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, had provided guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year from the enactment date. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and elected to account for GILTI in deferred taxes. Refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

# Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Additionally, we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that required us, upon conversion, to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock. Our Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and related Warrants contained various conversion features, which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the Convertible Notes and Warrants under the treasury stock method were included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion was dilutive. However, the Note Hedges were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share unless actually exercised, as their pre-exercised effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.

<a name="740"></a>
# Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

<a name="741"></a>
# Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

<a name="742"></a>
# Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

<a name="743"></a>
# Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, aggregated approximately 19% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 27, 2019 and 28% of our account receivable balance from two customers as of January 28, 2018. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.

<a name="746"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 51

<a name="747"></a>
# Accounts Receivable

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.

<a name="748"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.

<a name="749"></a>
# Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

<a name="750"></a>
# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Refer to Note 5 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

<a name="751"></a>
# Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer relationships. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the

# Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

<a name="757"></a>
# Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries. We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. We are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity investments through net income rather than other comprehensive income. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

<a name="758"></a>
# Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

The FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases under which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months. We will adopt this guidance using the optional transition method at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 and will not restate comparative prior periods. Additionally, we will elect the package of practical expedients as permitted by the guidance. We are in the process of finalizing changes to our systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements and currently expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $500 million.

In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. The standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

<a name="759"></a>
# Note 2 - New Revenue Accounting Standard

<a name="760"></a>
# Method and Impact of Adoption

On January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a $7 million increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax. Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted. The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019 was not significant.

<a name="761"></a>
# Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations

Deferred revenue is comprised mainly of customer advances and deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS related to software licensing. The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during fiscal year 2019:

Balance as of January 27, 2019: $138

Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. As of January 27, 2019, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $305 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

# Note 3 - Stock-Based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our ESPP.

Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows:

| |January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cost of revenue|$27|$21|$15|
|Research and development|$336|$219|$134|
|Sales, general and administrative|$194|$151|$98|
|Total|$557|$391|$247|

Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.

# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 54

Beginning fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs to
reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on
the Company’s level of achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in
the beginning of each fiscal year.

Of the total fair value of equity awards, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are
not expected to vest for fiscal year 2019 was $88 million.

**Aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense**
| |January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|
|---|---|---|
|In millions|$1,580|$1,091|

Estimated weighted average remaining amortization period (In years):

- RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs: 2.2
- ESPP: 0.8

The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:

**ESPP Assumptions**
| |January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|---|
|Weighted average expected life (in years)|0.1-2.0|0.5-2.0|0.5-2.0|
|Risk-free interest rate|1.6%-2.8%|0.8%-1.4%|0.5%-0.9%|
|Volatility|24%-75%|40%-54%|30%-39%|
|Dividend yield|0.3%-0.4%|0.3%-0.5%|0.7%-1.4%|

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The
risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the
expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we
use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting;
therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.

Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.

# Equity Incentive Program

We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive
plans.

<a name="773"></a>
# Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the
2007 Plan.

The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors
and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 230 million shares of our common stock may be issued
pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan,
under which, as of January 27, 2019, there were 35 million shares available for future issuance.

Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grants made prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5% vesting semi-annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016, 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.

Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment.

<a name="778"></a>
# Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Up to 89 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 27, 2019, we had issued 29 million shares and reserved 60 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months.

Employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an offering may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld up to certain limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15%. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. Employees may end their participation in the 2012 Plan at any time during the offering period, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with us. In each case, the employee’s contributions are refunded.

|Balances, January 27, 2019|16|$129.92|

Vested and expected to vest after January 27, 2019 Includes PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest based on the corporate financial performance level achieved for fiscal year 2019.

(1) Includes market-based PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum target for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3-year measurement period is achieved. Depending on the ranking of our TSR compared to the respective TSRs of the companies comprising the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during that period, the market-based PSUs issued could be up to 45 thousand shares.

As of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, there were 35 million and 16 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans.

# Note 4 - Net Income Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

| |Year Ended|January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Numerator:| | | | |
|Net income|$4,141|$3,047|$1,666| |
|Denominator:| | | | |
|Basic weighted average shares| |608|599|541|
|Dilutive impact of outstanding securities: Equity awards| |17|24|26|
|1.00% Convertible Senior Notes| |—|5|44|
|Warrants issued with the 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes| |—|4|38|
|Diluted weighted average shares| |625|632|649|
|Net income per share:| | | | |
|Basic (1)|$6.81|$5.09|$3.08| |
|Diluted (2)|$6.63|$4.82|$2.57| |

Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive: 5, 4, 8

(1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.

(2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.

The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018, or the Convertible Notes, were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes had a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeded the adjusted conversion price of $20.02 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding were also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. As of January 27, 2019, there were no Convertible Notes or Warrants outstanding.

Refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants.

# Note 5 - Goodwill

The carrying amount of goodwill was $618 million, and the amount of goodwill allocated to our GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units was $210 million and $408 million, respectively, as of both January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018. There were no changes to the carrying amount of goodwill during fiscal years 2019 and 2018. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.

|Total intangible assets|$686|$(641)|$45|$664|$(612)|$52|

The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is due to purchases of licensed technology during fiscal year 2019.

Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $29 million, $55 million, and $68 million, respectively. Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of January 27, 2019 is estimated to be $21 million in fiscal year 2020, $12 million in fiscal year 2021, $5 million in fiscal year 2022, $5 million in fiscal year 2023, and $2 million in fiscal year 2024.

# Note 8 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets
or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a
quarterly basis. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for fiscal
year 2019. Level 3 financial assets and liabilities are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and
include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best
information available under the circumstances.

**Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities**
|Assets|Pricing Category|January 27, 2019 (In millions)|January 28, 2018 (In millions)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cash equivalents and marketable securities: Corporate debt securities|Level 2|$2,620|$1,295|

# Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities

The estimated amount of product returns and warranty liabilities was $18 million and $15 million as of January 27, 2019 and January 28,
2018, respectively.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for
matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology
related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not
have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

# Litigation

Polaris Innovations Limited

On May 16, 2016, Polaris Innovations Limited, or Polaris, a non-practicing entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc. (formerly
WiLAN Inc.), filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.
Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe six U.S. patents relating to the control of dynamic random-access
memory, or DRAM. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against
NVIDIA. On September 14, 2016, NVIDIA answered the Polaris Complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and
invalidity of the six Polaris patents.

On December 5, 2016, the Texas Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to transfer and ordered the case transferred to the Northern District of
California.

Between December 7, 2016 and July 25, 2017, NVIDIA filed multiple petitions for inter partes review, or IPR, at the United States Patent
and Trademark Office, or USPTO, challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the U.S. litigation. The USPTO
instituted IPRs for four U.S. patents and declined to institute IPRs on two U.S. patents. On June 19, 2018, the USPTO issued a Final
Written Decision on one IPR, finding claims 1-23 and 28 unpatentable but that claims 24-27 were not proved unpatentable. On November
20, 2018, the USPTO issued Final Written Decisions on two IPRs, finding claims 1, 4, 8-12, 16, 18, 43, 45, and 48-51 unpatentable but
that claims 2-3, 5, 14, 17, 19-23, 26-31, and 44 were not proved unpatentable. On December 4, 2018, the USPTO issued a Final Written
Decision on one IPR, finding all claims unpatentable. On December 19, 2018, the USPTO issued a Final Written Decision on one IPR,
finding claims 1-14 unpatentable.

Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe three patents relating to control of DRAM. On July 14, 2017, NVIDIA filed defenses to the infringement allegations including non-infringement with respect to each of the three asserted patents. On September 3, 2018, NVIDIA filed a rejoinder with additional noninfringement arguments. On December 4, 2018, NVIDIA filed a further rejoinder with additional noninfringement, nullity, and FRAND arguments.

An oral hearing is scheduled for February 21, 2019.

Between March 31, 2017 and June 12, 2017, NVIDIA filed nullity actions with the German Patent Court challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the German litigation.

# ZiiLabs 1 Patents Lawsuit

On October 2, 2017, ZiiLabs Inc., Ltd., or ZiiLabs, a non-practicing entity, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe four U.S. patents relating to GPUs, or the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. ZiiLabs is a Bermuda corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Asia Limited, a Hong Kong company which is itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Ltd., a publicly traded Singapore company. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or indirect infringement of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. On November 27, 2017, NVIDIA answered the ZiiLabs complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. On January 10, 2018, ZiiLabs filed a first amended complaint asserting infringement of a fifth U.S. patent.

On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the ZiiLabs 1 case pending the resolution of the U.S. International Trade Commission, or USITC, investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents.

On February 1, 2019, NVIDIA entered into an immaterial agreement in which it receives a license to the ZiiLabs patents and a dismissal of the ZiiLabs 1 and 2 Patent Lawsuits. The ZiiLabs 1 and 2 district court cases were dismissed pursuant to a stipulation of dismissal filed on February 8, 2019. The Administrative Law Judge issued an Initial Determination on February 12, 2019, granting the motion to terminate the USITC investigation addressing the ZiiLabs 2 patents.

<a name="834"></a>
# ZiiLabs 2 Patents Lawsuits

On December 27, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a second complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed four additional U.S. patents, or the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. The second complaint also seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or indirect infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the district court action on the ZiiLabs 2 patents pending the resolution of the USITC Investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents.

On December 29, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a request with the USITC to commence an Investigation pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the unlawful importation of certain graphics processors and products containing the same. ZiiLabs alleges that the unlawful importation results from the infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents by products from respondents NVIDIA, ASUSTeK Computer Inc., ASUS Computer International, EVGA Corporation, Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd., G.B.T. Inc., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., MSI Computer Corp., Nintendo Co., Ltd., Nintendo of America Inc., PNY Technologies Inc., Zotac International (MCO) Ltd., and Zotac USA Inc.

On February 28, 2018, NVIDIA and the other respondents answered the USITC complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the four asserted ZiiLabs 2 patents.

On May 10, 2018, the Administrative Law Judge then presiding over the investigation issued an Initial Determination terminating the investigation with respect to one of the patents. On July 17, 2018, the USITC affirmed this decision on modified grounds.

# Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits

On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669), naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s officers. The complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between August 10, 2017 and November 15, 2018. The plaintiff also alleges that the NVIDIA officers who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of equitable/injunctive or other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar purported securities class action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief. The two cases have been related and are before the same judge. A stipulation to consolidate the Iron Workers and Oto actions is pending before the Court. On February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective counsel to be appointed lead counsel.

On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on the behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern District of California, captioned Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of NVIDIA against the members of NVIDIA’s board of directors and certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. On February 12, 2019, a substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766), naming the same named defendants, and seeking the same relief. On February 19, 2019, a third substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The Booth Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking substantially the same relief.

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants.

# Accounting for Loss Contingencies

We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. As of January 27, 2019, with the exception of immaterial amounts, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

# Note 13 - Income Taxes

The income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following:

| |Year Ended|January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Current income taxes:| | | | |
|Federal|$1|$464|$7| |

|Foreign|-|$17|($2)| |
|Total deferred|($315)|($359)|$197| |

|Foreign|$2,053|$1,596|$1,305| |
|Income before income tax|$3,896|$3,196|$1,905| |

(1) The increase in domestic income is primarily due to jurisdictional allocation of stock-based compensation charges.

The income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, 33.9%, and 35% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, to income before income taxes as follows:

| |Year Ended|January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|January 29, 2017|

The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:

| |January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|
|---|---|---|
|Deferred tax assets:| | |
|Net operating loss carryforwards|$70|$67|
|Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes|$41|$24|
|Property, equipment and intangible assets|$2|$32|
|Research and other tax credit carryforwards|$626|$579|
|Stock-based compensation|$25|$24|
|GILTI deferred tax assets|$376|$0|
|Gross deferred tax assets|$1,140|$726|
|Less valuation allowance|($562)|($469)|
|Total deferred tax assets|$578|$257|
|Deferred tax liabilities:| | |
|Acquired intangibles|($2)|($4)|
|Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries|($35)|($26)|
|Gross deferred tax liabilities|($37)|($30)|
|Net deferred tax asset|$541|$227|

(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $560 million and $245 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $19 million and $18 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets are included in Other assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We recognized an income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019, and income tax expense of $149 million and $239 million for fiscal years 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was (6.3)%, 4.7%, and 12.5% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

In December 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019.

In fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the TCJA by applying the SEC guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and recognized a reduction of $368 million to the provisional amount recorded at January 28, 2018 as a component of income tax expense (benefit). This adjustment primarily relates to the effects of electing to account for GILTI in deferred taxes, as described below. Our final tax benefit from the TCJA was $501 million.

The one-time transition tax is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits, or E&P, of our foreign subsidiaries. We had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of these same earnings. We recorded a provisional one-time transition tax liability of $971 million at January 28, 2018. Upon further analysis of the TCJA and Notices and regulations issued by the US Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, we finalized our calculations of the transition tax liability during fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, we increased our transition tax provisional amount by $33 million.

As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. As a result, at January 28, 2018 we had recorded a provisional income tax expense of $43 million on the write-down of our deferred tax balance. Upon further analysis of certain aspects of the TJCA, including immediate expensing of qualified capital expenditures and refinement of our calculations, we reduced our provisional tax expense amount by $20 million.

# Fiscal Year 2019, Page 68

The TCJA subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. Under U.S. GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat
taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Because we were
still evaluating the GILTI provisions as of January 28, 2018, we recorded no GILTI-related deferred balances. After further evaluation, we
elected to account for GILTI deferred taxes. In fiscal year 2019, we recorded additional deferred tax assets as a net $370 million income
tax benefit related to GILTI in deferred taxes.

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in
the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higher U.S federal
research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019.

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of
the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in
jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S.
federal statutory tax rates, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal
research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% for fiscal year 2018
and 35% for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan
and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research
tax credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

As of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, we had a valuation allowance of $562 million and $469 million, respectively, related to
state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future
taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax
asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

As of January 27, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $72 million, $291 million and $290
million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2023 and 2020, respectively. The foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of $290 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 27, 2019, we had federal research tax
credit carryforwards of $347 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2037. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $718
million, of which $687 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $31 million is attributable
to various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal year 2020. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards,
remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other
facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject
to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax
provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may
expire or be denied before utilization.

As of January 27, 2019, we had $477 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $432 million would affect our effective tax rate if
recognized. However, approximately $82 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if
recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $432 million
of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 27, 2019 consisted of $142 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $290
million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.

|Balance at beginning of period|$447|$224|$230|
|Increases in tax positions for prior years|52|7|3|

|Lapse in statute of limitations|(10)|(5)|(7)|
|Balance at end of period|$477|$447|$224|

We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.

Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 27, 2019, January 28, 2018, and January 29, 2017, we had accrued $21 million, $15 million, and $13 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 27, 2019, unrecognized tax benefits of $142 million and the related interest and penalties of $21 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 27, 2019, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

We are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States and throughout the world. As of January 27, 2019, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2018. As of January 27, 2019, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include India, Taiwan, China and UK for fiscal years 2003 through 2018.

During fiscal year 2019, we repurchased a total of 9 million shares for $1.58 billion and also paid $371 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.

Through January 27, 2019, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. In November 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program. As of January 27, 2019, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.

# Note 15 - Employee Retirement Plans

We have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, participating employees may defer up to 80% of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits and we match a portion of the employee contributions. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $39 million, $23 million, and $12 million, respectively. We also have defined contribution retirement plans outside of the United States to which we contributed $31 million, $25 million, and $23 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

# Note 16 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.

We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying graphics architecture.

Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.

Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most.

The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

# Fiscal Year 2020, Page 9

Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI
frameworks, Software Development Kits, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, for software applications and game titles
that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and
organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our GPU and CUDA platforms. We now
have over 1.6 million registered developers across our platforms, including accelerated computing, gaming, deep learning, autonomous
machines, and others.

As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms and
complete systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our
platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.
Sales to Dell Technologies Inc., or Dell, accounted for 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020.

<a name="925"></a>
# Backlog

Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our
shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability.
Our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules, thus, we believe that only a small portion of our
backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.

<a name="926"></a>
# Seasonality

Our GPU and Tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government
and cloud service provider data centers, although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry. Our consumer products
typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers,
some of our products for notebooks or game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker
revenue in the fourth and first quarters. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.

<a name="927"></a>
# Manufacturing

We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we
employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging.
This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such
areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant
costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used
in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the
majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional
quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.

We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co.
Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering,
Inc., Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd.,
and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms.
We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and
memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.

We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration, and then
ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party
warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications,
and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutions.

We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and ODMs such as
Quanta Computer and Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key
elements such as the GPU, SoC and memory are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other
components used in the production process.

We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platform-by-platform basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products. A substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands.

Our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 47% to $10.90 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 compared with the end of fiscal year 2019.

<a name="931"></a>
# Competition

The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.

A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SOCs, and other accelerated and AI computing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.

Our current competitors include:

- Suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, or Intel, and Xilinx, Inc.;
- Large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc.; and
- Suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, and Xilinx, Inc. or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors.

# Patents and Proprietary Rights

We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2020 to October 2039. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:

- The location in which our products are manufactured;
- Our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
- The degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
- The commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.

We have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.

# ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks
including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial
condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of
your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial
may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

<a name="942"></a>
# Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners

If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial
results may be adversely impacted. We created GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large
markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological
change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our
success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products,
services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable technical,
financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the development of technologies and
business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and data center markets, which
presents additional risks to our business. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in
these areas, including customer service and support. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are
subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce
significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services
and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative
products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate
the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as
market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.

Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue. Our target markets remain extremely
competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry
standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services
and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among
other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain
their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property,
or IP, portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These
competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer
trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and
obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable to successfully
compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this
competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and
technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition,
the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which
could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.

System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue
and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation. Security breaches, computer
malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly
evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or
---

# # Nvidia Corporation - Quarterly Report

<a name="944"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2020, Page 13

Implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses.

Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.

We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.

We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:

- a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;
- a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
- a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
- a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;
- loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
- a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
- delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.

In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.

We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available

Software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.

For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.

Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.

If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share. Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.

Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their

Interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.

In January 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. The impact has extended to other regions. We have operations and employees in China, and the region represents an important end market for our products. Our customers and suppliers within China and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures. The coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business.

If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed. We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. Such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell-through, as we experienced with our mid-range gaming GPUs in fiscal year 2019. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:

- Changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
- Changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
- A sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
- A higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
- Our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
- Less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
- Increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.

The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.

Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.

We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. For fiscal year 2020, 11% of our total revenue was from one customer, Dell. Our operating results in the foreseeable
---
<a name="950"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Report

<a name="951"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2020, Page 16

Future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:

- most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;
- our partners may develop their own solutions;
- our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or
- our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.

We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade restrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.

We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business. We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 92% of total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and 87% for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2018. Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 25% of our revenue for fiscal year 2020, even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Additionally, as of January 26, 2020, approximately 46% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:

- international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union, and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;
- unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;
- differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
- local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;
- exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;
- disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and
- increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.

If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.

If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful

# Fiscal Year 2020, Page 17

In our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments, including the Mellanox acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. In March 2019, we announced our agreement to acquire Mellanox for approximately $6.9 billion. The Mellanox acquisition and other past or future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:

- Difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
- Diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
- Assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
- Integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
- Coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;
- Difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;
- Difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;
- Failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;
- Legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
- Uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
- Negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;
- The need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
- Potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and
- Impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.

Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters

Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from

a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to
suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments,
or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be
negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which
could negatively impact our operating results.

Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents,
trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries
in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant
resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect
our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or
intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology
and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business
information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in
research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We continuously assess whether and where to seek
formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections
will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors
should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.

Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are
not limited to:

- our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
- our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
- fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies;
- changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;
- our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;
- our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
- product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
- our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;
- supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products;
- inventory write-downs;
- our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors;
- the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;
- customer bad debt write-offs;
- any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
- unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
- changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
- general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.

Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure
to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience
substantial price volatility.

Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from
using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.

Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy
and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of
personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating
results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our
partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business
activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims.

Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which
continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or
GDPR, which requires companies to meet new requirements effective as of May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including
its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR
requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and
data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a
manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying
with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on
our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to
stop the alleged noncompliant activity.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected
tax rates.

As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-
added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and
international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or
international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense
and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.

Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes
in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising
from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax
returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and
in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based
compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they
occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other
regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute
of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.

Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.

We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving
shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. For example, multiple securities
litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading
statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. In addition, a stockholder, purporting
to act on behalf of the Company, filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the Company against the members of
our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel
inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.

Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an
injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies,
such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business,
results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming,
and disruptive to our operations.

In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.

Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:

- the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
- the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
- advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
- the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
- a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
- the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
- the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.

On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

# ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Not applicable.

<a name="961"></a>
# ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California. It includes twelve leased commercial buildings totaling 1,093,529 square feet, and real property that we own totaling 720,046 square feet. Our owned property consists of two commercial buildings and a building under construction. The construction is targeted for completion in fiscal year 2022. In addition, we also lease data center space in Santa Clara, California.

Outside of Santa Clara, California, we lease facilities in a number of regional facilities in other U.S. locations that are used as research and development centers and/or sales and administrative offices. Outside of the United States, we own a building in Hyderabad, India, that is being used primarily as a research and development center. We also lease facilities in various international locations that are used as research and development centers and/or sales and administrative offices. These leased facilities are located primarily in Asia and Europe. In addition, we also lease data center space in various locations around the world.

We believe that we currently have sufficient facilities to conduct our operations for the next twelve months. For additional information regarding obligations under leases, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

<a name="967"></a>
# ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 14, 2020, we had approximately 301 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.

<a name="968"></a>
# Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through January 26, 2020. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.

As of January 26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox.

<a name="969"></a>
# Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding

We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2020, we withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $551 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.

# Overview

<a name="984"></a>
# Our Company and Our Businesses

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a focus on PC
graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D
graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for VR, HPC, and AI.

Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying graphics architecture. From our proprietary
processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization,
Data Center, and Automotive.

Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI
data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand incorporates GPUs and
multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and
entertainment devices.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April
1998.

OEM and Other revenue was $505 million, down 34% from a year ago, primarily due to the absence of cryptocurrency-specific product sales.

Gross margin for fiscal year 2020 was 62.0%, up 80 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.

Operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $3.92 billion, up 16% from a year ago, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs.

Income from operations for fiscal year 2020 was $2.85 billion, down 25% from a year earlier. Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2020 were $2.80 billion and $4.52, respectively, both down 32% from a year earlier reflecting lower revenue and higher operating expenses.

On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commission in December 2019. In addition, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in May 2019. Discussions with China's regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.

In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $10.90 billion as of January 26, 2020, compared with $7.42 billion as of January 27, 2019. The increase primarily reflects growth in operating cash flow.

In January 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. The impact has extended to other regions. We have operations and employees in China, and the region represents an important end market for our products. Our customers and suppliers within China and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures. The coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business.

GPU Business

In Gaming, we extended NVIDIA’s family of Turing-based GPUs with the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1660 and GTX 1650, as well as with our new SUPER line, including the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, RTX 2070 SUPER, RTX 2060 SUPER, GTX 1660 SUPER, and GTX 1650 SUPER; and accelerated momentum of ray-tracing games by supporting a growing list of titles; introduced new RTX Studio laptops powered by GeForce RTX and Quadro RTX GPUs for online and studio-based creatives and prosumer customers; unveiled two new models of the SHIELD TV streaming media player; and introduced two new service offerings for GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.

# Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

<a name="993"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.

The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019. The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM, other components, and prior architecture components and chips. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.

Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.

# Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.

Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units.

# Fiscal Year 2020, Page 28

GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 26, 2020 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.

We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs. Revenue from Quadro GPUs
for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations. Data Center revenue, which
includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales.

Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019.
This was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in Automotive
revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements.

Concentration of Revenue
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and
2019, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are
initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business. No customer
represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of
semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs,
manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty
provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service
arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.

Our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven
by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.

Inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales of inventory that was
previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, the
overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:

GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily
driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.

Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when
compared to fiscal year 2019.

|Sales, general and administrative expenses|$1,093|$991|$102|10%|
|Total operating expenses|$3,922|$3,367|$555|16%|

Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee
additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation
expense.

# Total Other Income, Net

<a name="1009"></a>
# Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $178 million and $136 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016. Interest expense was $52 million and $58 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

<a name="1010"></a>
# Other, Net

Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was not significant during fiscal year 2020 and was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments.

<a name="1011"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognized income tax expense of $174 million for fiscal year 2020 and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9% and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to changes in working
capital driven by a reduction in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in operating income.

Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower purchases, higher
sales, and lower maturities of marketable securities in preparation for the acquisition of Mellanox.

Cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to no share repurchases in
fiscal year 2020 and lower tax payments related to employee stock plans.

The next installment of $33 million is classified as a current income tax payable. The installment amounts are equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025 and 25% in fiscal year 2026. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

# Excluded Obligations

Excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of $211 million which consists of $180 million and the related interest and penalties of $31 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 26, 2020. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.

# ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

<a name="1025"></a>
# Investment and Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.

As of January 26, 2020, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $1 million.

In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="1026"></a>
# Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2020 and 2019.

Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices.

prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies
other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating
expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to
spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to
operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.

We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities
that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the
hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of January 26, 2020, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

# Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
January 26, 2020 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 26, 2020.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.

<a name="1034"></a>
# Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

<a name="1035"></a>
# Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are

# Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2020, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

<a name="1055"></a>
# Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal year 2020.

<a name="1056"></a>
# Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

<a name="1057"></a>
# Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management.

and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<a name="1060"></a>
# Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the
accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

<a name="1061"></a>
# Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write
down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of the Company’s
inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product
purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Management applies significant judgment
in the valuation of inventories, which involves estimating future demand and market conditions. As of January 26, 2020, the Company’s
consolidated inventories balance was $979 million.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the
provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when
developing their provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including management’s assumptions related to future demand and market
conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures over the provisions for excess
or obsolete inventories, which included evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion
on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s
provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market
conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or
obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of
underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and
market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether
the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii)
the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual
results of the same period.

Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our Company

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 will be a 53-week year.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through specific steps outlined.

Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs, and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. Additional details are provided regarding customer programs involving rebates and marketing development funds (MDFs).

# Fiscal Year 2020, Page 46

<a name="1091"></a>
# License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

<a name="1092"></a>
# Software Licensing

Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.

<a name="1093"></a>
# Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $15 million, $21 million, and $25 million, respectively.

<a name="1094"></a>
# Product Warranties

We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

<a name="1095"></a>
# Stock-based Compensation

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

<a name="1096"></a>
# Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

<a name="1097"></a>
# Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency

Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an

# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES - NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<a name="1103"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2020, Page 48

Other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost
basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to
the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the instrument
before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate
the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss
component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income or loss.

<a name="1104"></a>
# Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair
values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019. Marketable securities are comprised
of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable
securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities
and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the
derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are
recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to
the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses
on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in
earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting,
changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

<a name="1105"></a>
# Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents,
marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income
securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.
Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, was approximately
21% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 26, 2020 and 19% of our accounts receivable balance from
one customer as of January 27, 2019. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain
an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount
based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of
credit.

<a name="1106"></a>
# Accounts Receivable

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to
make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts
based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial
condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.

<a name="1107"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out
basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer
fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such
purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component
parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value
or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess
quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about
future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the
inventory that is not subsequently written-up.

<a name="1108"></a>
# Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based
on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or
disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The
estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization

...assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the
shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

<a name="1113"></a>
# Leases

We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are
included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our
obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our
incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease
incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.

Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

<a name="1114"></a>
# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment
exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit
basis.

Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors
affecting the reporting units.

Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value.
The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial
information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and
require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.

Refer to Note 6 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

<a name="1115"></a>
# Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and
customer relationships. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using
a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that
pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its
estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group
exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and
would no longer be depreciated.

28, 2019 using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance
sheet. Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

<a name="1121"></a>
# Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current
GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable
and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit
loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We plan
to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year
2021. We do not currently believe it will have a material impact upon adoption.

<a name="1122"></a>
# Note 2 - Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies
Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125
per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The consummation of the merger is conditioned
on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions,
including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations
under the Merger Agreement. In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received
regulatory approvals for the deal from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commission in December 2019. In addition,
the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed
acquisition expired in May 2019. Discussions with China's regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation,
are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020. If the Merger Agreement
is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be
obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.

<a name="1123"></a>
# Note 3 - New Lease Accounting Standard

<a name="1124"></a>
# Method and Impact of Adoption

On January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method by recognizing a
cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet and not adjusting comparative information for prior periods.
In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us not
to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired
or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases.

The cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $470
million of operating lease assets and $500 million of operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
difference of $30 million represents deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was an offset
to the opening balance of operating lease assets.

<a name="1125"></a>
# Lease Obligations

Our lease obligations consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities,
and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2021 and 2035.

The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:

| |Year Ended January 26, 2020|Year Ended January 27, 2019|Year Ended January 28, 2018|
|---|---|---|---|
|ESPP| | | |
|Weighted average expected life (in years)|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|0.5-2.0|
|Risk-free interest rate|1.5%-2.6%|1.6%-2.8%|0.8%-1.4%|
|Volatility|30%-82%|24%-75%|40%-54%|
|Dividend yield|0.3%-0.4%|0.3%-0.4%|0.3%-0.5%|

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.

Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.

Equity Incentive Program

We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans.

Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.

The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 230 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 26, 2020, there were 29 million shares available for future issuance.

Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vested over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grants made prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5% vesting semi-annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016, 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.

Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment.

# Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Up to 89 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 26, 2020, we had issued 30 million shares and reserved 59 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months.

Employees or those employed by an affiliate of ours are eligible to participate as designated by the Board. Employees who participate may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15%. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering.

(1) Includes the number of PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest based on the corporate financial performance level achieved for fiscal year 2020.

(2) Includes the number of market-based PSUs granted that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum goal for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3-year measurement period is achieved. Depending on the ranking of our TSR compared to those companies comprising the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during that period, the market-based PSUs issued could be up to 60 thousand shares.

As of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, there were 29 million and 35 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans.

# Note 5 - Net Income Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

| |Year Ended January 26, 2020|Year Ended January 27, 2019|Year Ended January 28, 2018|
|---|---|---|---|
|Numerator:|$2,796|$4,141|$3,047|

|Net income per share:| | | |
|Basic (1)|$4.59|$6.81|$5.09|
|Diluted (2)|$4.52|$6.63|$4.82|

Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive: 11, 5, 4 for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively.

# Note 6 - Goodwill

The carrying amount of goodwill was $618 million, and the amount of goodwill allocated to our GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units was $210 million and $408 million, respectively, as of both January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019. There were no changes to the carrying amount of goodwill during fiscal years 2020 and 2019. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.

|Total intangible assets|$715|($666)|$49|$686|($641)|$45|

The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is due to purchases of licensed technology during fiscal year 2020. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $25 million, $29 million, and $55 million, respectively.

The gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, temporary in nature, and driven primarily by changes in interest rates. We have the intent and ability to hold our investments until maturity. For fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were no other-than-temporary impairment losses, and net realized gains/losses were not significant.

# Note 9 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for fiscal year 2020. Level 3 financial assets and liabilities are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances.

# Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

**Notional Value of Foreign Currency Forward Contracts**
| |January 26, 2020|January 27, 2019|
|---|---|---|
|Designated as cash flow hedges|$428 million|$408 million|
|Not designated for hedge accounting|$287 million|$241 million|

As of January 26, 2020, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.

During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

<a name="1179"></a>
# Long-Term Debt

2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026

In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.

The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

Purchase Obligations

As of January 26, 2020, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $1.16 billion and other purchase obligations totaling $186 million.

Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities

The estimated amount of product returns and warranty liabilities was $15 million and $18 million as of January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, respectively.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Litigation - Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits

On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669), naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s officers. On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar purported securities class action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief. On February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective counsel to be appointed lead counsel. On March 12, 2019, the two cases were consolidated under case number 4:18-cv-07669-HSG and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. On May 2, 2019, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On June 21, 2019, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint. The consolidated complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017, and November 14, 2018. The plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On August 2, 2019, NVIDIA moved.

to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws
by NVIDIA or the named defendants.

On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern District of California,
captioned Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of NVIDIA against the members of NVIDIA’s
board of directors and certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate
assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and
misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff is seeking
unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.
On February 12, 2019, a substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v. Huang, et.
al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766), naming the same named defendants, and seeking the same relief. On February 19, 2019, a third substantially
similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The Booth Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No.
3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking substantially the same relief. On March 12, 2019, the three derivative
actions were consolidated under case number 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation.
The parties stipulated to stay the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation pending resolution of any motion to dismiss
that NVIDIA may file in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation.
On September 24, 2019, two shareholders, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed two identical lawsuits in the District of Delaware.
One is captioned Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and the other is captioned Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case
No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA). The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation
of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of
allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The
plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified
corporate governance measures. On December 11, 2019, the court approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the Lipchitz and Huang
actions pending resolution of the motion to dismiss filed by NVIDIA in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation.

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters,
naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.

# Accounting for Loss Contingencies

We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of
favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results,
liquidity or financial position. As of January 26, 2020, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal
proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described
above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:

| |January 26, 2020|January 27, 2019|
|---|---|---|
|Deferred tax assets:| | |
|Net operating loss carryforwards|$62|$70|
|Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes|39|41|
|Property, equipment and intangible assets|12|2|
|Operating lease liabilities|114|—|
|Research and other tax credit carryforwards|605|626|
|Stock-based compensation|28|25|
|GILTI deferred tax assets|428|376|
|Gross deferred tax assets|1,288|1,140|
|Less valuation allowance|(621)|(562)|
|Total deferred tax assets|667|578|
|Deferred tax liabilities:| | |
|Acquired intangibles|(1)|(2)|
|Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries|(40)|(35)|
|Operating lease assets|(107)|—|
|Gross deferred tax liabilities|(148)|(37)|
|Net deferred tax asset|$519|$541|

(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $548 million and $560 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $29 million and $19 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets are included in Other assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We recognized an income tax expense of $174 million and $149 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2018, respectively, and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9%, (6.3)%, and 4.7% for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA.

The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higher U.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

As of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million and $562 million, respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

As of January 26, 2020, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $70 million, $153 million and $295 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023 and 2021, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $295 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 26, 2020, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $314 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2039. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $814 million, of which $774 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $40 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2021. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.

As of January 26, 2020, we had $583 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $464 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $104 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $464 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 26, 2020 consisted of $180 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $284 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.

<a name="1200"></a>
# Reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits:

| |January 26, 2020|January 27, 2019|January 28, 2018|
|---|---|---|---|
|Balance at beginning of period|$477|$447|$224|
|Increases in tax positions for prior years|7|52|7|
|Decreases in tax positions for prior years|-|(141)|(1)|
|Increases in tax positions for current year|104|129|222|
|Lapse in statute of limitations|(5)|(10)|(5)|
|Balance at end of period|$583|$477|$447|

We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.

Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 26, 2020, January 27, 2019, and January 28, 2018, we had accrued $31 million, $21 million, and $15 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 26, 2020, unrecognized tax benefits of $180 million and the related interest and penalties of $31 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 26, 2020, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 26, 2020, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2019. As of January 26, 2020, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include India, China, and United Kingdom for fiscal years 2003 through 2019.

# Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity

Capital Return Program

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Through January 26, 2020, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.

During fiscal year 2020, we paid $390 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.

Preferred Stock

As of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

Common Stock

We are authorized to issue up to 2.00 billion shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share par value.

# Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans

We have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, participating employees may defer up to 80% of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits and we match a portion of the employee contributions. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $44 million, $39 million, and $23 million, respectively. We also have defined contribution retirement plans outside of the United States to which we contributed $32 million, $31 million, and $25 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

<a name="1206"></a>
# Note 17 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.

We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying graphics architecture.

Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.

Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most.

The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue included in all other is Intel licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related and other costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record inter-segment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 4

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.

The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding.

NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, software, algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.

Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $24 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual computing. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs power many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the pace described by Moore’s Law, we deliver GPU performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.

Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the world’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding as a result of the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators.

Researchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to weather forecasting. With support for more than over 600 applications - including the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from weather prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. NVIDIA GPUs power the top supercomputers in the United States and Europe. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers nearly 70%, and 8 of the top 10, supercomputers on the global TOP500 list.

The world’s leading cloud service providers and consumer internet companies use our GPUs to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end-users, including search, social networking, online shopping, live video, translation, AI assistants, navigation, and cloud computing.

A rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our GPUs and AI software to bring automation to the products and services they build. For example, the transportation industry is turning to our platforms for AV; the healthcare industry is leveraging them for enhanced medical imaging and accelerated drug discovery; and the financial services industry is using them for fraud detection.

Professional designers use our GPUs to create visual effects in movies and design products ranging from soft drink bottles to commercial aircraft.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Arm Limited, or Arm, and SoftBank Group Capital Limited and SVF Holdco (UK) Limited, or together, SoftBank, for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The announced acquisition is expected to bring together NVIDIA's leading AI computing platform with Arm's vast ecosystem to create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence, accelerating innovation while expanding into large, high-growth markets. We paid $2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.

Our GPU computing solutions enhance productivity and introduce new capabilities for critical parts of the workflow for major industries such as automotive, media and entertainment, architectural engineering, oil and gas, and medical imaging.

Designers who build the products we use every day need the images that they view digitally to mirror reality. This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering. Our DesignWorks software delivers this to designers and enables an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. It also allows an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.

Our Professional Visualization platforms are critical enablers in many fields, such as design and manufacturing and digital content creation. Design and manufacturing encompass computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video editing and post-production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics.

The NVIDIA RTX platform makes it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and environments with physically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time. Many leading 3D design and content creation applications developed by our ecosystem partners now support RTX, allowing professionals to accelerate and transform their workflows with NVIDIA RTX GPUs.

Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise applications. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life all deploy this technology, powered by our GPUs.

Data Center:

The NVIDIA computing platform is focused on accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads, such as AI, data analytics, graphics and scientific computing, across hyperscale, cloud, enterprise, public sector, and edge data centers. The platform consists of our energy efficient GPUs, interconnects and systems, our CUDA programming model, and a growing body of software libraries, Software Development Kits, or SDKs, application frameworks and services.

In the field of AI, NVIDIA’s platform accelerates both deep learning and machine learning workloads. Deep learning is a computer science approach where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data in the form of images, sounds and text - in some instances better than humans. Machine learning is a related approach that leverages algorithms as well as data to learn how to make determinations or predictions, often used in data science. HPC, also referred to as scientific computing, uses numerical computational approaches to solve large and complex problems. For both AI and HPC applications, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform greatly increases the performance and power efficiency of high-performance computers and data centers.

We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such as reading medical images, to enabling fraud detection in financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling.

based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger
revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. However, there can be no assurance that
this trend will continue.

<a name="1278"></a>
# Manufacturing

We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we
employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging.
This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such
areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant
costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used
in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most
of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality
assurance, marketing, and customer support.

We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd,
to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon
Hai Precision Industry Co., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to
perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd. to
manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase
substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from
Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.

We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration, and then
ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers
from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards
based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and
AIC solutions.

We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as Flex Ltd. and Fabrinet, and ODMs such as Wistron Corporation,
to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key

# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 10

Elements such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.

<a name="1281"></a>
# Competition

The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, including Intel’s recent announcement that they will introduce high performance GPUs, embedded SOCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in our fiscal year 2022.

<a name="1282"></a>
# Our current competitors include:

- Suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, and Xilinx, Inc.;

<a name="1283"></a>
# Patents and Proprietary Rights

We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2021 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:

- The location in which our products are manufactured;
- Our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
- The degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
- The commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.

result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners, and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to
anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies
as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.

For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor, including for our
interconnect products. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability
to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent
us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our
position in future competitive bid selection processes.

Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware
manufacturers and software developers. Additionally, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including
safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Furthermore, winning a product design
does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.

Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product
and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our
competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours,
which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors
operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP
portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may
be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition
their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity
and packaging materials, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit
and switch suppliers and already have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology
and supporting such customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own
products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them. Consequently, these customers may become competitors
to us. Further, each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation. If we are unable to successfully compete in our target
markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including
in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would
cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets
has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers,
any of which could negatively affect our financial results.

Risks Related to Our Supply and Manufacturing

We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces
our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule
and could harm our business.

We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we are
dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co.
Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble,
test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. In the past we have not had and going forward we may not
have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. Nevertheless, we may enter into long-term procurement
and capacity commitments

As our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain. As our business grows, we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our business. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, scale our supply chain and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:

- a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices, which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in sufficient quantities and/or in a timely manner;
- a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate, or any, manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
- a failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
- a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;
- loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
- a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality;
- delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.

In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.

We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.

If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share. Our products, including both hardware and software offerings, are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write-off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in

Failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or recalls due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.

<a name="1312"></a>
# Risks Related to Our Operating Business

If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed. Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:

- Changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
- Changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
- A sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
- A higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
- Our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
- Less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
- Increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.

The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.

# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 17

Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or
capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may
also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels
to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on
a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could
be damaged.

System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected
revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years.
These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate
preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced
computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential
information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These
hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security
vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality
over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on
products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may
impact our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of our third party software service providers, was subject to a data
security breach. To date, our investigations of this breach, which were supported by a third party expert, have not identified any adverse
impact to NVIDIA. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our
systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer
more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses. We must also continue to
develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the
evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted.

Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of
proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the
parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory
inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these
challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and
loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical
functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results,
stock price and reputation.

Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud
service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical
epidemics or pandemics (including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate
change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an
increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order
to fully resume operations. Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business
and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our
research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some
of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data
center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in
these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are
concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion
of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Geopolitical change or changes in government
regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and
economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In
particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement

could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political or social unrest, elections and post-election developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, other negative impacts from climate change, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. It continues to affect our business in both positive and negative ways, and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform benefited from work-from-home trends in mobile workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In our Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results.

The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. A significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our headquarters is located in California. Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees continue to work remotely. There is no

certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. While the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or treat its impact, availability of vaccines or other treatments, further related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.

We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or investments, including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.

We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion in April 2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Furthermore, if we are unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner, including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. In addition, we have made and may in the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:

- difficulty in combining the technology, products, or operations of the acquired business with our business;
- difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees;
- diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
- assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
- integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
- coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;
- acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating international operations and joint ventures;
- difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all;
- difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other approvals or financing;

The following are some of the risk factors associated with NVIDIA Corporation:

- The potential impact of complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an acquisition.
- The potential impact on stock price and financial results if regulatory approval for an acquisition is not obtained.
- Failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or strategic investment.
- Legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment.
- The potential for acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.
- The potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration.
- Uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment.
- Negative changes in general economic conditions in regions or industries where NVIDIA or its targets operate.
- The need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet expectations.
- Potential failure of due diligence processes to identify significant issues with acquired assets or companies.
- Impairment of relationships with employees, vendors, and customers as a result of acquisitions or investments.

NVIDIA Corporation relies significantly on revenue from a limited number of customers within its partner network. Loss of these customers could adversely affect revenue. Factors affecting this revenue stream include:

- Customers' ability to cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little notice.
- Partners developing their own solutions.
- Customers purchasing products from competitors.
- Partners discontinuing sales or losing market share in markets where NVIDIA products are purchased.

Restrictions on selling products or providing technology and services due to U.S. trade restrictions could also impact NVIDIA's financial condition. Additionally, risks associated with international operations and adverse economic conditions pose threats to the business.

NVIDIA maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to address potential losses from customers' inability to make payments. Future provisions or write-offs could negatively impact financial results.

# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 21

Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 81% of total revenue for fiscal year 2021, 92% for fiscal year 2020 and 87% for fiscal year 2019. Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 23% of our revenue for fiscal year 2021. Additionally, as of January 31, 2021, approximately 53% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:

- international economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;
- unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws and employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions;
- differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
- local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;
- exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;
- disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations;
- increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits; and
- natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations,” above), and other catastrophic events.

If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.

We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.

Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.

Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is likely that the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A slowdown in economic growth could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the

inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on inventories. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.

Additionally, we have engineering facilities, corporate and sales support operations and some of our manufacturing located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the Middle East may directly affect our business. In addition, the State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have in the past been the subject of an economic boycott and could be in the future. Other countries have in the past, and may continue in the future, to restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Further, we are unable to ship products manufactured in Israel to certain countries. These laws and policies may have an impact on our results of operations. Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We continue to evolve our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources to our employees who are working remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the essential labs and offices that remain open. If we do not continue to anticipate and address the safety and wellness needs of our employees sufficiently and/or in a timely manner, their productivity could be impacted, or we could fail to retain them.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.

Additional factors, other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:

- our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
- our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
- fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID-19, as discussed further in the risk factor “If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed;"

Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters

Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.

We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.

We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross-license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.

Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our intellectual property if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.

Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims.

Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which required companies to meet requirements effective as of May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. California’s privacy laws will expand substantially effective January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. Since the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the states in the United States and the United States Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.

The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may

<a name="1332"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Reports

<a name="1333"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 25

Disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA.

Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.

Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.

We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. For example, we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. In addition, multiple stockholders, purporting to act on our behalf, filed derivative lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.

Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.

In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.

Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.

Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:

- the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
- the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
- advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
- the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
- a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
- the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
- the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.

On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.

Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Additionally, our obligation to make payments related to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through January 31, 2021. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

In fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021.

Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding

We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2021, we withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $942 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.

# Overview

Our Company and Our Businesses

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI.

Through fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. We changed our reportable segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.

Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.

All prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments. Our market platforms – Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.

Demand

Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made
---
<a name="1349"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Reports

<a name="1350"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 30

by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.

COVID-19 The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Since March 2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel. Our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. In Professional Visualization, mobile workstations continue to benefit from work-from-home trends, and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In Automotive, COVID is no longer having a significant impact on demand. Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information under the heading “Risk Factors”. We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.

# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 31

From a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was up 41% from a year ago, reflecting higher sales across desktop and laptop GPUs for gaming, and game-console SOCs. GPUs for gaming benefited from the ramp of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.

Professional Visualization revenue was down 13% from a year ago due to lower sales of GPUs for desktop workstations as enterprise demand was impacted by COVID.

Data Center revenue was up 124% from a year ago. Revenue growth was driven by our Mellanox acquisition and the ramp of the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In fiscal year 2021, Mellanox revenue contributed 10% of total company revenue.

Automotive revenue was down 23% from a year earlier, reflecting lower revenue from the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements, partially offset by increases in AI cockpit and autonomous vehicle solutions.

OEM and Other revenue was up 25% from a year ago, primarily due to higher volume of entry-level laptop GPUs.

Gross margin for fiscal year 2021 was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges.

Operating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $5.86 billion, up 50% from a year ago. The growth was influenced by the inclusion of Mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, employee additions and increases in employee compensation and related expenses. Additionally, acquisition-related and other costs of $411 million primarily include $190 million in non-recurring intangible amortization of Mellanox order backlog, $123 million in recurring amortization of Mellanox intangible assets, and $40 million related to the pending acquisition of Arm.

Income from operations for fiscal year 2021 was $4.53 billion, up 59% from a year earlier. Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2021 were $4.33 billion and $6.90, up 55% and 53%, respectively, from a year earlier.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.56 billion as of January 31, 2021, compared with $10.90 billion as of January 26, 2020. The increase primarily reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March 2020 and cash-flow generation, partially offset by acquisitions.

We paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2021.

# Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to business combinations, inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

<a name="1359"></a>
# Business Combinations

The application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analyses. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period of resolution, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.

Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our assessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility.

<a name="1360"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or

# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 33

Unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.

Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.

<a name="1363"></a>
# Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

<a name="1364"></a>
# Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

<a name="1365"></a>
# License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="1366"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change.

# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 34

based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States,
or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential
United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be
due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we
may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that
management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage
limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To
the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income
tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based
solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a
component of income tax expense.

Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information.

<a name="1369"></a>
# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment
exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting
unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We changed our reportable segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking"
starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance
to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the
reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to
our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $3.85 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a
reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments
and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we
believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a qualitative assessment and concluded
there was no goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional

# Revenue by Reportable Segments

| |January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|Change $|Change %|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Graphics|$9,834|$7,639|$2,195|29%|
|Compute & Networking|$6,841|$3,279|$3,562|109%|
|Total|$16,675|$10,918|$5,757|53%|

Graphics: Graphics segment revenue increased by 29% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting growth in GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro/NVIDIA RTX workstations.

Compute & Networking: Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 109% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture systems and new products.

<a name="1375"></a>
# Concentration of Revenue

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81% and 92% of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021. Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.

<a name="1376"></a>
# Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs.

<a name="1377"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Reports

<a name="1378"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 36

Revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.

Our overall gross margin was 62.3% and 62.0% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2021 was driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of $263 million.

Inventory provisions totaled $116 million and $161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:

- Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix within Quadro/Nvidia RTX.
- Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by the addition of Mellanox products, higher margins in Data Center compute systems, and lower product mix of certain Automotive solutions.

# Operating Expenses

| |January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|Change $|Change %|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Research and development expenses|$3,924|$2,829|$1,095|39%|
|Sales, general and administrative expenses|$1,940|$1,093|$847|77%|
|Total operating expenses|$5,864|$3,922|$1,942|50%|

<a name="1380"></a>
# Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased by 39% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven primarily by the acquisition of Mellanox. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs.

<a name="1381"></a>
# Sales, General and Administrative

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 77% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation.

<a name="1382"></a>
# Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $57 million and $178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $184 million and $52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

<a name="1383"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognized income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7% and 5.9% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 37

<a name="1386"></a>
# Income Tax

The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

**January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020**
| |January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|
|Cash and cash equivalents|$847 million|$10,896 million|
|Marketable securities|$10,714 million|$1 million|
|Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities|$11,561 million|$10,897 million|

**Year Ended January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020**
| |January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|
|Net cash provided by operating activities|$5,822 million|$4,761 million|
|Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities|($19,675) million|$6,145 million|
|Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities|$3,804 million|($792) million|

As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $664 million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm, which was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion, the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The cash flow allocation of the payment resulted in $1.36 billion of advanced consideration included in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $0.17 billion for the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and $0.47 billion in prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets. Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, due to higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital include increases in purchases of inventory and outstanding trade receivables, both due to higher fiscal year 2021 revenue, and a prepayment of royalties to Arm.

Cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed acquisition of Arm, higher purchases of marketable securities, higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, and lower sales of marketable securities, offset by higher maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, offset by payments related to tax on restricted stock units.

# Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations.
As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient
liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including our proposed acquisition of Arm. We
continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and
efficiently finance our capital requirements beyond twelve months. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and
financial institutions, and foreign government entities, and certificates of deposits. These marketable securities are primarily denominated
in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information.

During fiscal year 2022, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by
our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion related to property and equipment, including
construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus.

We have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not
accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2021 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring
additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="1391"></a>
# Capital Return to Shareholders

In fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends
under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends
thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

As of January 31, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to
$7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021.

<a name="1392"></a>
# Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities

We have outstanding $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and $500 million
of Notes due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes.

We have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.

We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving
loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 31, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement.

We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we had not issued
any commercial paper.

Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
discussion.

<a name="1393"></a>
# Contractual Obligations

We have $157 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax benefits of $395
million, which includes related interest and penalties of $43 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 31, 2021.
We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to
uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently
under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

# Investment and Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.

As of January 31, 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a yield floor of 0%, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $24 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $8 million, respectively.

In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

# Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.

Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.

We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $84 million and $43 million lower as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.

If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse
impact on income before taxes of approximately $44 million and $29 million as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively.
These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets
and liabilities balances.

# Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2021 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.

<a name="1406"></a>
# Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Other than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, there were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting despite the fact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19
pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their
operating effectiveness. We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have
taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal year 2020.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of

<a name="1449"></a>
# Management Discussion and Analysis

Management and directors of the company are responsible for providing reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could impact the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not always prevent or detect misstatements. Evaluation of effectiveness is subject to the risk of controls becoming inadequate due to changing conditions or deteriorating compliance.

<a name="1450"></a>
# Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters identified in the audit of the consolidated financial statements relate to the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. Specifically, the valuation of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired in the transaction. Significant auditor judgment and subjectivity were involved in determining the fair values of these assets, requiring evaluation of management's estimates and assumptions.

<a name="1451"></a>
# Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd.

The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. in fiscal year 2021 involved the recording of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets. The fair values were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, with management exercising significant judgment in estimating these values based on various assumptions.

<a name="1452"></a>
# Valuation of Developed Technology and In-process Research and Development Intangible Assets Acquired

The audit effort focused on evaluating management's assumptions related to revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Procedures included testing controls over the valuation of intangible assets and assessing the reasonableness of management's assumptions. Specialized professionals were engaged to assist in the evaluation process.

<a name="1453"></a>
# Valuation of Inventories

The Company's inventory provisions for excess or obsolete inventories involve charging cost of sales to adjust inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value. These provisions are based on future demand assumptions and market conditions, considering inventory levels and product purchase commitments.

<a name="1454"></a>
# Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories

Inventory provisions primarily relate to excess product quantities, with assessments based on inventory levels, future purchase commitments, and demand forecasts. The Company writes down inventory to ensure it is valued appropriately based on market conditions.
---
<a name="1455"></a>
# # NVIDIA Corporation - 10-K Report

<a name="1456"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 46

Disclosed by management, the inventory provisions developed include assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 31, 2021, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $1,826 million.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.

# Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our Company

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were both 52-week years.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through specific steps outlined.

Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.

Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

(Continued)

<a name="1483"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2021, Page 53

<a name="1484"></a>
# License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

<a name="1485"></a>
# Software Licensing

Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.

<a name="1486"></a>
# Product Warranties

We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

<a name="1487"></a>
# Stock-based Compensation

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

<a name="1488"></a>
# Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

<a name="1489"></a>
# Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.

<a name="1492"></a>
# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<a name="1493"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

<a name="1494"></a>
# Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.

<a name="1495"></a>
# Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.

We generally classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

<a name="1496"></a>
# Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses.

included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the
marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities
and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative
and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings
in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative
instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a
component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized
in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities,
and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of
investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for
specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by
credit insurance and letters of credit.

Accounts Receivable
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for expected losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall
estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and
the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.

Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis.
Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly,
testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout,
and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory
provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory
provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared
to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost
basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on
the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related
cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings
are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements
and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the
asset.

Leases
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are
included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our
obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our
incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease
incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease

When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.

<a name="1504"></a>
# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.

Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.

Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.

<a name="1505"></a>
# Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired intellectual property. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from two to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

<a name="1506"></a>
# Business Combination

We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.

Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities

Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment
or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued
using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of
market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent
financing activities by the investee.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing incurred loss
impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of
reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including
available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not
material to our consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 - Business Combination

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank all allotted
and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in Signing Consideration and will pay upon
closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value
of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance
targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either
up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in
restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for
the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion,
both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified
governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation
of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators
in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated
under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was
allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe
the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.

Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $7.13 billion.
Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired
Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.

The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal year 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $28 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2021.

Fiscal Year 2021, Page 60

On January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method. Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2022 and 2035.

Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 31, 2021, are as follows:

|Fiscal Year|Operating Lease Obligations (In millions)|
|---|---|
|2022|$152|
|2023|$135|
|2024|$115|
|2025|$94|
|2026|$86|
|2027 and thereafter|$288|
|Total|$870|

Less imputed interest: $115

Present value of net future minimum lease payments: $755

Less short-term operating lease liabilities: $121

Long-term operating lease liabilities: $634

Operating lease expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $145 million, $114 million, $80 million, respectively. Short-term and variable lease expenses for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were not significant.

Other information related to leases was as follows:

| |Year Ended January 31, 2021|Year Ended January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|
|Supplemental cash flows information|$141|$103|
|Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (1)|$200|$238|

(1) Fiscal year 2021 includes $80 million of operating lease assets addition due to a business combination.

As of January 31, 2021, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.6 years and a weighted average discount rate of 2.87%. As of January 26, 2020, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.3 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.45%.

# Note 4 - Stock-Based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our ESPP.

Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows:

| |Year Ended|January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|January 27, 2019|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cost of revenue| |$88|$39|$27|
|Research and development| |$860|$540|$336|
|Sales, general and administrative| |$449|$265|$194|
|Total|$1,397|$844|$557| |

Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019.

The following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans:

| |Year Ended|January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|January 27, 2019|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs| |9|7|4|
|Estimated total grant-date fair value| |$2,764|$1,282|$1,109|
|Weighted average grant-date fair value per share| |$307.25|$184.47|$258.26|

| |ESPP| | |
|---|---|---|---|
|Shares purchased|1|1|1|
|Weighted average price per share|$139.19|$148.76|$107.48|
|Weighted average grant-date fair value per share|$67.65|$64.87|$38.51|

As of January 31, 2021, there was $3.17 billion of aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and 0.9 years for ESPP.

The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with certain assumptions:

| |ESPP| | |
|---|---|---|---|
|Weighted average expected life (in years)|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|
|Risk-free interest rate|0.1%-1.6%|1.5%-2.6%|1.6%-2.8%|
|Volatility|26%-89%|30%-82%|24%-75%|
|Dividend yield|0.1%-0.3%|0.3%-0.4%|0.3%-0.4%|

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.

Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.

<a name="1534"></a>
# Equity Incentive Program

We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive
plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed the stock-based awards granted under
their stock incentive plans and substituted them with our RSUs.

<a name="1535"></a>
# Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the
2007 Plan.

The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock
appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and
consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 31, 2021, up to 244 million shares of our common
stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 2 million shares were issuable upon the exercise
of outstanding stock options. All options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by May 2024 if not exercised. Currently, we grant
RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 31, 2021, there were 37 million shares available
for future issuance.

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service,
with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter,
or (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary
of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary
of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally
determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.

<a name="1536"></a>
# Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan.
Employees who participate may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock. Starting in March
2021, employees who participate may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may
decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase
periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within
the offering. As of January 31, 2021, we had 60 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

As of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, there were 37 million and 29 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans.

As of January 31, 2021, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $1.20 billion, with an average exercise price of $14.40 per share and an average remaining term of 1.7 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $521 million, $84 million, and $180 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Upon the exercise of an option, we issue new shares of stock.

The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, was $2.67 billion, $1.45 billion, and $2.62 billion, respectively.

# Note 5 - Net Income Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

| |January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|January 27, 2019|
|---|---|---|---|
| |(In millions, except per share data)| | |
|Numerator: Net income|$4,332|$2,796|$4,141|

|Basic weighted average shares|617|609|608|
|Dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards|11|9|17|
|Diluted weighted average shares|628|618|625|
|Net income per share: Basic (1)|$7.02|$4.59|$6.81|
|Net income per share: Diluted (2)|$6.90|$4.52|$6.63|

Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive: 3, 11, 5 for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.

# Note 6 - Goodwill

We changed our reportable segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, as discussed in Note 17 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. Comparative periods presented reflect this change. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $3.85 billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $618 million and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $271 million, respectively. Goodwill increased by $3.57 billion in fiscal year 2021 due to goodwill of $3.43 billion arising from the Mellanox acquisition, and goodwill of $143 million from other acquisition activities, all of which were allocated to the Compute & Networking reporting unit. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.

|Patents and licensed technology|706|(475)|231|46|
|Total intangible assets|$3,986|(1,249)|$2,737|49|

Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $612 million, $25 million, and $29 million, respectively. Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of January 31, 2021 is estimated to be $548 million in fiscal year 2022, $545 million in fiscal year 2023, $423 million in fiscal year 2024, $367 million in fiscal year 2025, $97 million in fiscal year 2026, and $757 million in fiscal year 2027 and thereafter.

As of January 31, 2021, the amount of our remaining performance that has not been recognized as revenue was $683 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 44% as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

# Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

**Notional Value of Foreign Currency Forward Contracts**
| |January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|
|Designated as cash flow hedges|$840 million|$428 million|
|Not designated for hedge accounting|$441 million|$287 million|

As of January 31, 2021, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.

During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

Both the September 2016 Notes and the March 2020 Notes, or collectively, the Notes, are our unsecured senior obligations and
rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally
subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value
of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.
The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:

# Credit Facilities

We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan
commitments up to $425 million. As of January 31, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts and were in compliance with the required
covenants under this agreement. The Credit Agreement expires October 2021.

We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we had not issued
any commercial paper.

# Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Obligations

As of January 31, 2021, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $2.54 billion, which are expected to occur over the
next 12 months, and other purchase obligations totaling $317 million, which are primarily expected to occur over the next 18 months.

Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities

The estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $22 million (January 31, 2021) and $15 million (January 26, 2020).

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for
matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology
related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do
not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability for such indemnifications.

Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserts that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017, and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On June 29, 2020, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the individual defendants. As of September 14, 2020, the motion was fully briefed but the Court has not yet issued a decision.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019, and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.

The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019, and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.

# Accounting for Loss Contingencies

As of January 31, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity, or financial position.

The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:

| |January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|
|Deferred tax assets:| | |
|GILTI deferred tax assets|$709|$428|
|Research and other tax credit carryforwards|$650|$605|
|Operating lease liabilities|$120|$114|
|Net operating loss carryforwards|$100|$62|
|Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes|$59|$39|
|Stock-based compensation|$36|$28|
|Property, equipment and intangible assets|$32|$12|
|Gross deferred tax assets|$1,706|$1,288|
|Less valuation allowance|($728)|($621)|
|Total deferred tax assets|$978|$667|
|Deferred tax liabilities:| | |
|Acquired intangibles|($191)|($1)|
|Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries|($111)|($40)|
|Operating lease assets|($111)|($107)|
|Gross deferred tax liabilities|($413)|($148)|
|Net deferred tax asset|$565|$519|

(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $806 million and $548 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $241 million and $29 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We recognized an income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7%, 5.9%, and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred tax liabilities and long-term tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price allocation. As a result of the acquisition, as of January 31, 2021, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.16 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

As of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million and $621 million, respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax

Assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

As of January 31, 2021, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $333 million, $308 million and $344 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $344 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 31, 2021, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $238 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2035. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $987 million, of which $944 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $43 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2022. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.

As of January 31, 2021, we had $776 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $606 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $132 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $606 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2021 consisted of $352 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable, $5 million recorded in current income taxes payable, and $249 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.

# Reconciliation of Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits:

| |January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|January 27, 2019|
|---|---|---|---|
|Balance at beginning of period|$583|$477|$447|
|Increases in tax positions for current year|158|104|129|
|Increases in tax positions for prior years (1)|60|7|52|
|Decreases in tax positions for prior years|(11)|—|(141)|
|Settlements|(5)|—|—|
|Lapse in statute of limitations|(9)|(5)|(10)|
|Balance at end of period|$776|$583|$477|

(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the Mellanox acquisition.

We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.

Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, we had accrued $44 million, $31 million, and $21 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 31, 2021, unrecognized tax benefits of $352 million and the related interest and penalties of $43 million are included in non-current income taxes payable, and unrecognized tax benefits of $5 million and the related interest and penalties of $1 million are included in current income taxes payable.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 31, 2021, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 31, 2021, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, and India for fiscal years 2005 through 2020.

# Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity

Capital Return Program

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Through January 31, 2021, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.

During fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.

<a name="1601"></a>
# Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans

We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $120 million, $76 million, and $70 million, respectively.

<a name="1602"></a>
# Note 17 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported two operating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in which our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The two new operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

# Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those
sections. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available
to our management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “goal,”
“would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “potential” and similar expressions intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our
actual results, performance, time frames or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, time frames or
achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K in greater detail under the heading “Risk Factors.” Given these risks, uncertainties and other factors, you
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and
assumptions only as of the date of this filing. You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K completely and with the understanding
that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We hereby qualify our forward-looking statements by
these cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly,
or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new
information becomes available in the future.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements
are based upon information available to us as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K , and while we believe such information
forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to
indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements
are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

In fiscal year 2022, our demand exceeded our supply in several areas, and our revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. However, there can be no assurance that these trends will continue. Our fiscal year 2022 supply-constrained environment or historical seasonality trends may not repeat.

<a name="1667"></a>
# Manufacturing

We do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.

We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often consign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract manufacturers.

We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto Co. Ltd. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.

<a name="1668"></a>
# Competition

The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices.

We undertake an annual analysis to ensure that our ESG priorities remain aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.

The following section provides an overview of some of these principles and practices. More information can be found on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, or CSR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CSR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.

<a name="1675"></a>
# Climate Change

In the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.

In our CSR Report, we report several metrics related to our environmental impact, our most recent full reporting year being fiscal year 2021, with our fiscal year 2022 metrics expected to be published in May 2022. There has been no material impact to capital expenditures, our results of operations or competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers.

Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs are inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput and performance per watt rather than absolute performance. GPU servers are approximately 40x more energy efficient than traditional CPU servers for AI workloads. The power efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 25 systems on the November 2021 Green500 list.

We plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change. The system will build a digital twin of the Earth on our Omniverse platform, enable scientists to do ultra-high-resolution climate modeling, and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of cities and nations so they can act with more urgency.

# Human Capital Management

We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of January 30, 2022, we had 22,473 employees in 32 countries. 16,242 were engaged in research and development and 6,231 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.

To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.

<a name="1677"></a>
# Recruitment

The demand for talent in new markets such as AI and deep learning is increasingly competitive. With differentiated hiring strategies for university, professional, executive, and for diversity, we have been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We attract global talent from universities, collaborations with college programs, professional organization affiliations, industry conferences, community resource group participation, direct sourcing, and outreach. Our employees play an important part in recruiting, with over 39% of our new hires coming from employee referrals.

<a name="1678"></a>
# Development and Retention

To support employee advancement, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one-on-one coaching, and ongoing feedback. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate learning paths focused on our most common challenges.

Development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current programs and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on developmental activities and pursuing internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.

To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.

In fiscal year 2022, our overall turnover rate was 4.9%.

<a name="1681"></a>
# Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being

Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and financial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.

<a name="1682"></a>
# Diversity and Inclusion

We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability. We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.

Other efforts we have been or are undertaking include:

- Expanded recruiting teams and deepened our college pipeline to engage more diverse students and partnering with minority-serving institutions and professional organizations;
- Supported the development of women employees to build a pipeline of future leaders;
- Supported underrepresented employees through our 11 internal community resource groups;
- Providing training and education to managers and peers on how to foster a supportive environment;
- Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.

As of January 30, 2022, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared and 6% of our workforce in the United States was composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.

<a name="1683"></a>
# Health and COVID-19

We support our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority. During fiscal year 2022 and the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our global protocols to keep our workforce safe. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we maintained appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. We have also made some of our offices accessible based on a clearly defined set of metrics while adhering to government guidelines. Steps we took to support employees include:

- Providing work from home support, including reimbursement for home office equipment and certain work from home expenses;

# ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form
10-K. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any
one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock
price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or
that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

<a name="1691"></a>
# Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets

If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and
financial results may be adversely impacted. Our accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.
These markets experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and
industry standards.

Our strategic and business success depends on our ability to:

- timely identify emerging industry changes, and develop new or enhance existing products, services and technologies that meet
the evolving needs of these markets;
- expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;
- accurately forecast demand in our businesses;
- meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change;
- manage product, software, and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;
- develop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including related to our acquisitions, customer support, e-commerce and IP
licensing capabilities; and
- complete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.

We make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating
history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop new products, services and
technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Achieving design wins, which is important to our success in several businesses, may involve a lengthy process and depend on our
ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers will demand. Unanticipated changes in industry standards or disruptive
technological innovation could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies. If our products are not in
compliance with prevailing industry and safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies.
Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. Furthermore, a
design win does not guarantee revenue.

We cannot ensure that our strategic direction will result in products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners.
If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our
strategies as market conditions evolve, our business will be harmed.

# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 15

Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.

Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, such as the high-end discrete GPUs offered by Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which may result in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of IP rights that may enable such customers to develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. If we are unable to successfully compete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline.

Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing

If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand, and our financial results could be harmed. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product releases and announcements, competing technologies, and other factors, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our products through channel partners, who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and demand for our products could impact our ability to properly forecast demand.

GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum.

It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products, and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. However, if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our gaming GPUs and limiting our ability to supply our gaming cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome. In addition, our products may be resold on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products compete with our distribution channels.

Consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center, and workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand.

These challenges may continue in the future when the effects of the pandemic subside. Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. We have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of the worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory. Demand for our products may be perishable or may disappear, which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause us to lose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished products and carry inventory for anticipated demand that does not materialize. We may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors. We may write-down our
---

<a name="1695"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 16

Inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand.

Situations that may result in excess inventory or related impairments include:

- changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy and changes in the credit market;
- higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
- new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases;
- increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;
- fluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or
- decrease in future demand, decrease in the cost of supply chain materials, or changes in the design of future products where we have entered into long-term supply commitments, including prepayments, particularly to the extent we are placing orders well in advance of our historical lead times and/or before the design of those products is final.

Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. If we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.

In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we are in today, we have placed and may continue to place non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six months’ lead time, we have begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. However, we may not be able to accurately predict when such periods of shortage will end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is served by our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.

We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.

We do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:

- lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;
- failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;

Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business

We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic conditions,
which may harm our business.

We conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged
by third parties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the
United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:

- domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business;
- differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;
- domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;
- disruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations;

• natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.

Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. More recently, increased inflation may impact supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs. To the extent such inflation continues, increases or both, it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.

Economic and industry uncertainty or changes could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:

- decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers or licensees;
- the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us;
- our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;
- the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensees;
- limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;
- difficulties in obtaining capital;
- reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations;
- lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and
- increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.

We have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing located in Israel. The State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have been and could in future be the subject of an economic boycott. Other countries have and may continue in the future restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Such laws and policies may have adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical. We have facilities in regions that may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk. These measures can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations, products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased levels of capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our

Operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business.

We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.

Risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:

- difficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of the acquired business;
- diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
- assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
- integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
- coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;
- difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
- difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing;
- Stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;
- legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
- potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;

• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;

• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;

• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;

• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring; and

• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.

System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.

Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.

For example, on February 23, 2022, we became aware of a security incident involving unauthorized access to our network by a group of independent criminal threat actors, not affiliated with any government or political cause. The threat actors obtained NVIDIA network credentials and through deception, obtained two-factor authentication capability and access to our network. The threat actors misappropriated certain NVIDIA proprietary information, including NVIDIA source code, and leaked some of that information online. Upon learning of the security incident, we engaged in remedial and preventative actions, rotated all NVIDIA network credentials to prevent further unauthorized access, hardened our network, analyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated, and notified law enforcement and other authorities.

Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.

Threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach.

To defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers. We may not always be able to detect vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.

Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial.

loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods
and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these
disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.

Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,
telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of
war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate
headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located
in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our
operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical
areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and
research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our
control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or
around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations. For example, the invasion by Russia of Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our employees
or operations both within and outside these regions, and may result in the loss of some or even all of our assets in those regions. Our
operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason,
including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic,
business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. For example, our operations could be harmed, and our costs could
increase, if the conflict between Russia and Ukraine results in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our foundry
partners, require to satisfy our needs. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and
consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party
systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial
expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales
and operating results.

We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected
if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With
several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results
depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In
the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their
purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel,
change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop
their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market
share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of
any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions,
or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees
and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly
competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also
must recruit and develop diverse talent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation
could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain
key employees, our business may be adversely affected. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and
stock-based compensation. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated
benefits of those transactions. We are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective
succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic
planning and execution and long-term success.

Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification
or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.
We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls
over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation of these processes and systems
is critical and they need to be scalable to support our growth, including for acquisitions of other businesses. We expect in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2023 to commence implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource
planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact
our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be
costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated
controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations.

Identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose
confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur
significant expenses and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required
to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our
access to the capital markets may be restricted, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions
or investigation by regulatory authorities.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.
COVID-19 has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors and
suppliers. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty, and
the limited availability of our supply chain and logistical services, may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial
results. While COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for certain of our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions
change. COVID-19 containment around the world has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and
support operations could limit our capacity to meet customer demand. Stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity
and components in our supply chain, which could increase our costs, limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all, or cause
us to hold excess inventory if demand changes.

COVID-19’s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has resulted in, and may continue to result
in, disruption of global financial markets, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could
impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.
We have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take further actions as required by
government regulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that our actions
will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. When we begin
to reopen our offices, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs.

The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute
our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. An extended period of global supply chain and economic
disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, and access
to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration of these impacts is uncertain.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors.
Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional
factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:

- our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and
services;

# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 23

Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters

Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.

We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business operations negatively. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations.

Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions or export control measures, which have and could in the future result in, among other things, severe or complete restrictions on exports to and other commerce and business dealings involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular entities and individuals. Such actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products, services and support into Russia or other regions determined to be supporting Russia, and restrict access by our Russian or Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our systems, negatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United States and foreign government bodies, we recently ceased product sales to Russia. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions, our employees, contractors, partners, and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. If we were ever found to have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.

Geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export controls, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. The increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target products

<a name="1711"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 24

and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions could limit
our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively impact our business and financial results. Deemed export control limitations
could negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.

Recent restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect
our Gaming business. Additionally, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased
taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory
actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.

Issues relating to the responsible use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability.
Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services, may result in
reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into
many of our products and services. AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI poses
emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society,
or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models
and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.
Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the cost of related research and development. Our
failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption
of AI in our products and services or cause reputational harm.

Increased scrutiny from shareholders and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities could
result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do
business with us.
Shareholder advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers
have focused increasingly on the ESG and sustainability practices of companies, including those associated with climate change and
human rights. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG
practices do not meet shareholder or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand,
reputation and business activities may be negatively impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosures
we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental
compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and talent
diversity and inclusion practices. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption.
We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, or choose
not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers, due to our policies. Also,
our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could have a material negative impact on
our reputation and business activities.

Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if
we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us,
our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling could include significant
damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our
products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to,
defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence legal proceedings in order to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact
our operating results. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found
to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. However, we may not
be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, we could
be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may
also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially
reasonable

# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 25

terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our
operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.
We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws
of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United
States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of
our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products;
as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also
may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal
protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be
approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.

We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligations. Privacy concerns relating to our products and
services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, or result in legal
or regulatory proceedings and liability.
Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to
privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the
processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with
regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in
AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data
in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business
activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.

Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The
European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR,
governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom,
respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data
about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue,
whichever is greater, and individuals may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists
a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations and could require us to change our
business practices.

Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally
restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual
Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found
to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-
border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing
business. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit
our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our
personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.

The United States federal, state and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach
notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California
residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about
how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action
for certain data breaches. California’s privacy laws will further expand in 2023 under the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA,
which may restrict the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising
techniques; restrict the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and
establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to impose administrative fines. Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and
Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. If we become subject to
new data privacy laws the risk of enforcement action against us could increase as we become subject to additional obligations.

The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are quickly changing
and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is
---
<a name="1714"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Reports

<a name="1715"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 26

inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices
and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we
rely may fail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security
obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional
reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these
events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.

We have exposure to tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes, including proposed changes to existing tax rules and regulations under the current U.S. administration and Congress and as a result of recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Starting in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. If Congress does not modify or repeal this provision, it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, recent proposals to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate or impose a minimum tax on financial statement income, increase U.S. taxation of international business operations and impose a global minimum tax, could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates. Numerous countries, as well as organizations such as the OECD, support the global minimum tax initiative and are considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business, which could materially impact our results of operations. Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.

Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders seeking to assert claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Our business is subject to laws and

<a name="1717"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 27

Regulations that are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.

As of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.

Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, or materially change our business.

We are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing.

Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.

Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to develop and sell graphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. As of March 11, 2022, we had approximately 313 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.

On July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock, resulting in each stockholder of record at the close of business on June 21, 2021 receiving a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date.

Since August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our stock. As of January 30, 2022, we have repurchased 1.04 billion shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion. The repurchases can be made through various methods and in compliance with applicable regulations.

During fiscal year 2022, we did not repurchase any shares. However, as of January 30, 2022, we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.

# Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement

On February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020.

Demand

Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, transitions, competitor product releases and announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and new cryptocurrency standards can impact and have impacted in the past cryptocurrency demand, and further impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly all our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. If attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome. Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.

Supply

Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain.

During fiscal year 2022, Nvidia Corporation made substantial strides in broadening its supply base to scale the company and better serve customer demand. The company expects to remain supply-constrained into the first half of fiscal year 2023, primarily in Gaming and Networking. Nvidia has taken measures such as placing non-cancellable inventory orders, paying premiums, and providing deposits to secure future supply and capacity.

<a name="1735"></a>
# COVID-19 Impact

The COVID-19 pandemic continued during fiscal year 2022, with most employees working remotely and limited business travel. Nvidia's Gaming, Data Center, and Professional Visualization market platforms experienced stronger demand as people continued to work, learn, and play from home. The company anticipates incremental expenses as offices begin to reopen.

Although nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are LHR to help direct GeForce GPUs to gamers, our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining. Gamers and others are therefore able to mine cryptocurrency using our GPUs, although we have limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or method of verifying transactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability to accurately estimate it. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future.

Data Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across both training and inference for cloud computing and AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models.

Professional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and strong demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in workloads such as 3D design, AI and rendering.

Automotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in legacy cockpit revenue. OEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for the fiscal year and was nominal in the prior year.

Revenue for our CMP products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above, is likely to have on future CMP sales.

Gross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins also benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center.

Operating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.

Income from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share were $9.75 billion and $3.85, up 125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The increase reflects operating cash flow generation and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds.

We paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022.

# Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies
and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our
critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

<a name="1745"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We
charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or
excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels
and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market
conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and
customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due
to unexpected end use cases, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact
of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of
customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.

The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact
of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to
purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead
times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend on to be twelve months or longer, which
requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of
our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors,
such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which
may impact demand for our products.

Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.

<a name="1746"></a>
# Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing,
and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2)
identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is
---
<a name="1747"></a>
# # NVIDIA Corporation Quarterly Report

<a name="1748"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 34

Allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation; and recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

<a name="1749"></a>
# Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.

Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

<a name="1750"></a>
# License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="1751"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. As of January 30, 2022, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.35 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $361 million and $3.99 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.

# Revenue by Reportable Segments

| |Year Ended|January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|$ Change|% Change|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Graphics| |$15,868|$9,834|$6,034|61%|
|Compute & Networking| |$11,046|$6,841|$4,205|61%|
|Total| |$26,914|$16,675|$10,239|61%|

Graphics: Graphics segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. The increase was driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and various factors contributing to the rise in Gaming revenue.

Compute & Networking: Compute & Networking segment revenue also increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. The growth was primarily fueled by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers and vertical industries.

<a name="1761"></a>
# Concentration of Revenue

Revenue from sales outside the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. No single customer represented 10% or more of total revenue in both years.

<a name="1762"></a>
# Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in 2022 was attributed to lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges and a higher-end mix within Graphics.

The gross margin of the Graphics segment increased in 2022 due to a higher-end mix within GeForce GPUs. In contrast, the gross margin of the Compute & Networking segment decreased primarily due to a shift in product mix.

Research and Development: Research and development expenses increased by 34% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, and higher infrastructure costs.

Sales, General and Administrative: Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles.

<a name="1766"></a>
# Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense was $236 million and $184 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.

Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in non-affiliated entities. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.

<a name="1767"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

| |January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|
|---|---|---|
|Cash and cash equivalents|$1,990|$847|
|Marketable securities|$19,218|$10,714|
|Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities|$21,208|$11,561|

| |Year Ended January 30, 2022|Year Ended January 31, 2021|
|---|---|---|
|Net cash provided by operating activities|$9,108|$5,822|
|Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities|($9,830)|($19,675)|
|Net cash provided by financing activities|$1,865|$3,804|

As of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $9.65 billion from the end of fiscal year 2021. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by prepayments of $1.87 billion for long-term supply agreements and increases in trade receivables due to higher revenue.

Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, reflecting lower payments in acquiring businesses as compared to the acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021, and higher marketable securities sales and maturities, partially offset by higher purchases of marketable securities.

Cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects a debt repayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock units.

# Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and additional supply. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.

Our marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

During fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.4 billion related to property and equipment.

We have approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Following the Domestication, we

have utilized almost all of our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, resulting in higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. This will impact cash flows from operations and result in significantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="1775"></a>
# Capital Return to Shareholders

In fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

As of January 30, 2022, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022.

<a name="1776"></a>
# Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program

As of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding:

- $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2023;
- $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2024;
- $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2026;
- $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2028;

Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

<a name="1777"></a>
# Contractual Obligations

We have unrecognized tax benefits of $729 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $59 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 30, 2022. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.

<a name="1778"></a>
# Climate Change

Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance activities.

To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends. There are no material current climate change regulations impacting us, however, we are monitoring potential regulation changes in California, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions. We believe that climate change has not had a material impact to our revenue to date. We have not experienced any significant physical effects of climate change to date on our operations and results, nor any significant impacts on the cost or availability of insurance. In fiscal year 2023, we plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change and increase our purchases of Renewable Energy Credits.

# ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

<a name="1782"></a>
# Investment and Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.

As of January 30, 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a zero percent yield floor, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $33 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $22 million, respectively.

At January 30, 2022, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="1783"></a>
# Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.

Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.

We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $103 million and $84 million lower as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.

If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $41 million and $44 million as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.

# Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on their evaluation as of January 30, 2022, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.

# Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 30, 2022.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.

<a name="1792"></a>
# Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases with the consolidated financial reporting and general ledger module to be implemented in fiscal year 2023. We will evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that affect our internal control over financial reporting.

<a name="1793"></a>
# Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

# Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

<a name="1836"></a>
# Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

<a name="1837"></a>
# Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

<a name="1838"></a>
# # NVIDIA Corporation Quarterly Report

<a name="1839"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 46

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<a name="1840"></a>
# Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

<a name="1841"></a>
# Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 30, 2022, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $2,605 million.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.

# Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our Company

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.

On July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2022 and 2020 were both 52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through specific steps outlined.

Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. Additional details are provided regarding product returns and sales return allowances.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<a name="1869"></a>
# (Continued)

Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

Software Licensing

Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.

Cloud Services

Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.

Product Warranties

We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Stock-based Compensation

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial.

Settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

<a name="1874"></a>
# Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.

<a name="1875"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

<a name="1876"></a>
# Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.

<a name="1877"></a>
# Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.

We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of

# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES - NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<a name="1880"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2022, Page 55

Tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale
of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income
(expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of
available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by
expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be
required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and
write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

<a name="1881"></a>
# Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their
fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021. Marketable securities
are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses
included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value
of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either
assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends
on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of
change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative
instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially
reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged
exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are
recognized in earnings.

<a name="1882"></a>
# Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents,
marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income
securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit
losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated
exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.

<a name="1883"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,
first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly,
testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final
test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts.

We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value
or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our
inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently
written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future
demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.

<a name="1884"></a>
# Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method
based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement
or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded.

The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets
recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter
of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Leases

We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.

Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.

Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.

Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

Business Combination

We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used.

To determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.

Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee. Marketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to require that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We early adopted this accounting standard in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the impact was immaterial.

# Note 2 - Business Combination

Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement On February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020.

Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.

Footnotes:

1. Represents the cash consideration of $125.00 per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately 56 million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.
2. Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.
3. Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services.

We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.

The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal year 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $28 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2021.

# Note 3 - Leases

Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2023 and 2035.

Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 30, 2022, are as follows:

|Fiscal Year|Operating Lease Obligations (In millions)|
|---|---|
|2023|$176|
|2024|$162|
|2025|$136|
|2026|$124|
|2027|$114|
|2028 and thereafter|$288|
|Total|$1,000|

Less imputed interest: $115

Present value of net future minimum lease payments: $885

Less short-term operating lease liabilities: $144

Long-term operating lease liabilities: $741

In addition to our existing operating lease obligations, we have operating leases that are expected to commence within fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of 7 years for $169 million.

Operating lease expense for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $168 million, $145 million, $114 million, respectively. Short-term and variable lease expenses for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not significant.

Other information related to leases was as follows:

|Year Ended|January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|---|
|Supplemental cash flows information|$154|$141|$103|
|Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (1)|$266|$200|$238|

(1) Fiscal year 2021 includes $80 million of operating lease assets addition due to Mellanox.

As of January 30, 2022, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.1 years and a weighted average discount rate of 2.51%. As of January 31, 2021, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.6 years and a weighted average discount rate of 2.87%.

Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows:

| |Year Ended|January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cost of revenue| |$141|$88|$39|

|Sales, general and administrative| |$565|$449|$265|
|Total| |$2,004|$1,397|$844|

Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020.

The following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans:

| |Year Ended|January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs| |18|36|28|
|Estimated total grant-date fair value| |$3,492|$2,764|$1,282|
|Weighted average grant-date fair value per share| |$190.69|$76.81|$46.12|

| |Year Ended|January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ESPP| |5|4|4|
|Weighted average price per share| |$56.36|$34.80|$37.19|
|Weighted average grant-date fair value per share| |$23.24|$16.91|$16.22|

As of January 30, 2022, there was $4.87 billion of aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and 0.9 years for ESPP.

The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with certain assumptions:

| |Year Ended|January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ESPP| | | | |
|Weighted average expected life (in years)|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|
|Risk-free interest rate|0%-0.5%|0.1%-1.6%|1.5%-2.6%| |
|Volatility|20%-58%|26%-89%|30%-82%| |
|Dividend yield|0.1%|0.1%-0.3%|0.3%-0.4%| |

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.

# Equity Incentive Program

Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.

We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.

# Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the 2007 Plan.

The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 30, 2022, up to 50 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 6 million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 30, 2022, there were 131 million shares available for future grants.

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter. PSUs vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.

<a name="1917"></a>
# Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the 2012 Plan.

Employees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 30, 2022, we had 233 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

|Balances, January 30, 2022|46| | |$114.19|
|Vested and expected to vest after January 30, 2022|46| | |$113.84|

As of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, there were 131 million and 148 million shares, respectively, of common stock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.

As of January 30, 2022, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $1.38 billion, with an average exercise price of $3.55 per share and an average remaining term of 1.1 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $741 million, $521 million, and $84 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Upon the exercise of an option, we issue new shares of stock.

The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and January 26, 2020, was $5.56 billion, $2.67 billion, and $1.45 billion, respectively.

# Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

**Notional Value of Foreign Currency Forward Contracts**
| |January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|
|---|---|---|
|Designated as cash flow hedges|$1,023 million|$840 million|
|Non-designated hedges|$408 million|$441 million|

As of January 30, 2022, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.

During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

The estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $46 million and $22 million as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included IP indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties.

<a name="1969"></a>
# Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits

The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument is scheduled for May 10, 2022.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.

The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.

# Accounting for Loss Contingencies

As of January 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $1.22 billion and $806 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $245 million and $241 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We recognized income tax expense of $189 million, $77 million, and $174 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9%, 1.7%, and 5.9% for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an

increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and the discrete benefit of the Domestication. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

On June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP to the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more closely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax laws. The impact of the Domestication, which is regarded as a change in tax status, resulted in a discrete benefit primarily from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $244 million in fiscal year 2022.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.

Our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox.

As of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.05 billion and $232 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

As of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million and $728 million, respectively, related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.

As of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $397 million, $345 million and $341 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $341 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $102 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.24 billion, of which $1.18 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $55 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.

As of January 30, 2022, we had $1.01 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $808 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $181 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $808 million of net unrecognized tax benefits as of January 30, 2022 consisted of $670 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $138 million reflected as a net reduction to the deferred tax assets.

| |January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|January 26, 2020|
|---|---|---|---|
|Balance at beginning of period|$776|$583|$477|
|Increases in tax positions for current year|246|158|104|
|Increases in tax positions for prior years|14|60|7|

|Balance at end of period|$1,013|$776|$583|

(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the Mellanox acquisition.

We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. As of January 30, 2022, we had accrued $59 million for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $670 million and related interest and penalties of $59 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.

Provisions on tax-related matters may change as revised estimates are made or matters are settled. As of January 30, 2022, we do not anticipate significant changes in our estimates on tax positions within the next twelve months.

# Capital Return Program

Since August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our stock. As of January 30, 2022, we have repurchased 1.04 billion shares for $7.08 billion. A remaining authorization allows repurchase of shares up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. From January 31, 2022, to March 17, 2022, 7.7 million shares were repurchased for $1.75 billion.

In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, cash dividends of $399 million, $395 million, and $390 million were paid to shareholders, respectively.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the retirement of 349 million treasury shares was approved. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in reductions in both accounts.

# Note 17 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance.

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds.

Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

| |Graphics|Compute & Networking|All Other|Consolidated|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Year Ended January 30, 2022:|$15,868|$11,046|$0|$26,914|
|Operating income (loss)|$8,492|$4,598|($3,049)|$10,041|
|Year Ended January 31, 2021:|$9,834|$6,841|$0|$16,675|
|Operating income (loss)|$4,612|$2,548|($2,628)|$4,532|
|Year Ended January 26, 2020:|$7,639|$3,279|$0|$10,918|
|Operating income (loss)|$3,267|$751|($1,172)|$2,846|

# ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Company

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.

The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely difficult with traditional coding. Some of the most recent applications of GPU-powered deep learning include recommendation systems, which are AI algorithms trained to understand the preferences, previous decisions, and characteristics of people and products using data gathered about their interactions, large language models, which can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets, and generative AI, which uses algorithms that create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos, based on the data they have been trained on.

NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.

Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $37 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU for general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs and networking accelerate many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the pace described by Moore’s Law, NVIDIA accelerated computing delivers performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.

Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the world’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality live video gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding because of the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators.

Researchers and developers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to climate forecasting. With support for more than 2,800 applications - including 23 of the top 25 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from climate prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers over 70% of the supercomputers on the global TOP500 list, including 23 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list.

Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our products are also sold direct to CSPs, enterprise customers, retail channels and consumers.

<a name="2073"></a>
# Seasonality

Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers, professional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2023, our supply exceeded our demand in several areas, and our revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. Historical seasonality trends may not repeat.

<a name="2074"></a>
# Manufacturing

We do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ key suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as memory, substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the

<a name="2075"></a>
# # NVIDIA Corporation Quarterly Report

<a name="2076"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 10

Production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.

We have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations. We utilize suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers, such as Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., or BYD Auto, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., or Hon Hai, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our networking cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often consign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract manufacturers.

We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc. and Chroma ATE Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto and Hon Hai, distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.

<a name="2077"></a>
# Competition

The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.

A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.

Our current competitors include:

- Suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;
- Large cloud services companies with internal teams designing chips and software that incorporate accelerated or AI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc., and Baidu, Inc.;
- Suppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms;

• suppliers of SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices,
such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation,
and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla, Inc.; and

• suppliers of interconnect, switch cable solutions, and DPUs such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks,
Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum
Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.

<a name="2080"></a>
# Patents and Proprietary Rights

We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and
licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from
March 2023 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our
patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also
rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products
are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as
the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We
continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:

- the location in which our products are manufactured;
- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
- the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.

We have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.

<a name="2081"></a>
# Government Regulations

Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign
governments.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government announced new license requirements that impact certain exports to China
(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of some of our data center products. The impact of the new license requirements is difficult
to quantify, and it may be challenging for us to manage our operations and forecast our operating results due to these requirements. Refer
to “Item 1A. Risk Factors- Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.

Additionally, our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs
incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material impact on our business. In February
2022, we announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant
regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal
year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.

Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations,
or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance
with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes,
import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation
restrictions, data privacy requirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity,
environmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI,

# Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance

NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices related to ESG. We assess our programs annually in consideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.

The following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and practices. More information can be found on the Corporate Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, or CR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.

<a name="2085"></a>
# Climate Change

In the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.

In our CR Report published in July 2022, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2022. Fiscal year 2023 metrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2024. There has been no material impact to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers.

Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs are inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the November 2022 Green500 list.

We plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.

<a name="2086"></a>
# Human Capital Management

We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had 26,196 employees in 35 countries, 19,532 were engaged in research and development and 6,664 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.

To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.

<a name="2087"></a>
# Recruitment

As the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted strong talent globally with our differentiated hiring strategies for university, professional, executive and diverse recruits. The COVID-19 pandemic created expanded hiring opportunities in new geographies and provided increased
---
<a name="2088"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Reports

<a name="2089"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 13

flexibility for employees to work from locations of their choice. Our workforce is about 80% technical and about 50% hold advanced degrees.

Earlier in fiscal year 2023, we slowed our hiring to focus on our current employees and manage costs. We maintain a connection for global talent from universities through on-campus collaborations with professors and student organizations, as well as engagement with technical organizations and participation at industry conferences. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 37% of our new hires in fiscal year 2023 coming from employee referrals.

<a name="2090"></a>
# Development and Retention

To support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate learning paths focused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current programs and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on developmental activities and internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.

To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.

We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In fiscal year 2023, our overall turnover rate was 5.3%.

<a name="2091"></a>
# Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being

Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.

We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and financial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.

<a name="2092"></a>
# Diversity and Inclusion

We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees.

When recruiting for new talent or managing current talent, we focus on recruiting, developing, and retaining a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.

To this end, we have been:

- Partnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;
- Assigning dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process;

<a name="2094"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 14

• Embedding inclusion recruiting partners throughout the business to help align candidates with internal opportunities;

• Supporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;

• Providing peer support and executive sponsors for nine internal community resource groups;

• Providing training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for diversity;

• Ensuring we have and review a diverse pool of candidates for requisitions; and

• Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.

As of the end of fiscal year 2023, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.

<a name="2095"></a>
# Health and COVID-19

We supported our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority during fiscal year 2023 and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to keep our workforce safe.

<a name="2096"></a>
# Hybrid Working Environment

We support a hybrid work environment, understanding that many employees want the flexibility to work in the office or from home, and make that decision based on the conditions around them at any point in time.

Steps we took to support employees working from home include:

• Home-focused health and well-being programs;

• Learning and development resources on how to work, lead and manage remotely; and

• Opportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually.

During fiscal year 2024, we will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days” for employees to recharge.

# Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets

Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results. Our accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry standards.

Our success depends on our ability to:

- timely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance existing products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies;
- develop new products and technologies through investments in research and development;
- launch new offerings with new business models including standalone software, cloud solutions, and software-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;
- expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;
- meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety and compliance standards;
- manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;
- develop, acquire, and maintain the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including our acquisitions integrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and
- complete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.

We invest in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed.

We will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services include NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI models, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has partnered with leading cloud service providers to host these services in their data centers, and we entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of fiscal year 2023 to support these offerings and our research and development activities. NVIDIA AI cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and several other software solutions. These new

# # NVIDIA Corporation - 10-K Report - February 24, 2023

<a name="2112"></a>
# Business Models and Strategies

Business models or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or as-a-service solutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings. Competition in our current and target markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue. Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline.

<a name="2113"></a>
# Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing

Failure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have had and may in the future have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.

We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.

Demand for our products is based on many factors in addition to the lead times described above that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:

- Competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements
- Changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand
- Sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local health issues
- Rapidly changing technology or customer requirements
- Time to market

• new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;

• new or unexpected end use cases;

• increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;

• business decisions made by third parties;

• the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and AI cloud service offerings;

• the demand for cryptocurrency mining; or

• government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage.

Our supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand. At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with demand for our products.

Our demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently negatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult and prior trends may not continue. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted.

We sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.

If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.

If we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and become a greater portion of our total supply while our

Revenue has sequentially declined. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.

We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications.

Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.

The use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, a number of years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the recently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In addition, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.

Additionally, we depend on developers and other third parties to build accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers to build applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.

Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedules and could harm our business. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. We face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:

- Lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;

- failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
- failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;
- limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;
- loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
- lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;
- suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;
- delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;
- requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;
- low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology; and
- disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts.

Defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause us to lose market share.

Our hardware and software product offerings are complex and they have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases, or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.

For example, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.

# Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business

Adverse economic conditions may harm our business. Economic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:

- increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin and may continue to do so;
- increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;
- decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;
- the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;
- limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;
- the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensing parties; reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations; lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and
- increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.

International operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business. We conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 69% of our revenue during fiscal year 2023 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations, and natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.

# NVIDIA Corporation - Cybersecurity Risks

Product, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation. Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.

Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible. Threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business.

To defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to detect all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm.

We hold confidential and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold propriety game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.

Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.

Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Our business and those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional.

# Risk Factors Related to Acquisitions and Investments

Unexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business.

We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, in February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded in operating expenses a $1.35 billion charge in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.

Additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:

- difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;
- diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
- assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
- integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
- coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;
- difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
- difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing;
- stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;
- legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
- potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;
- the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
- the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;

• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;

• exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities;

• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring; and

• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.

For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.

We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.

Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. In fiscal year 2023, we continued the implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.

Identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors, and suppliers. COVID-19-related disruptions have created and may continue to create supply chain and logistics constraints, and COVID-19 containment around the world has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations. Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment efforts in China. End customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may continue if lockdowns return. COVID-19 has also resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption of and volatility in global financial markets, which could impact overall technology spending or negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. All of these factors have had or could in the future have a material negative impact on our business.

We modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, including with respect to flexible work and social distancing measures, and we may take further actions as required by government regulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. These and other measures have caused and may in the future cause us to incur incremental expenses and costs.

The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:

- our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
- our ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
- our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for these customers and their extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs;
- our vendors' payment requirements;
- unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and
- changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.

Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated future financial results. For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility.

# Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters

Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.

We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.

Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.

The increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies has already resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls may be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which are increasingly likely, would restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and

Negatively impacting our business and financial results. Increasing use of economic sanctions may also impact demand for our products
or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include
deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap
or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but
also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our
products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new export restrictions and export licensing
requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well
as software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong
Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which
incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. The new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes
those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for
certain end users and for certain end uses in China.

We are required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), which could be costly and time consuming, and
adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition
period.

We have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new
A800 offering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirements, we may seek a license for the
customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them
in a timely manner. The new requirements may have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain
of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position
may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from
competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service
obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant
transition costs. Additionally, if we are unable to sell our alternative product offerings in China, we may have excess inventory, harming
our results. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we
cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-
sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives
to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.

Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely
affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue.

Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our environmental, social and governance
responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and
suppliers to do business with us.
Shareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have placed increased
importance on the implications of the social and environmental cost of their investments and these parties, as well as government
regulators, have focused increasingly on corporate ESG and sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with
climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. Additionally,
our ESG practices, oversight of ESG practices, or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator, or other industry
stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet sustainability disclosure or ESG reporting standards. We could also incur additional
costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, choose not to conduct business with
potential

customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm our
brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.
Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational and financial
harm and liability.
Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in
reputational and financial harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI
capabilities into many of our products and services. AI poses emerging ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect
its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on
society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy,
employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating
to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or
reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase
the cost of related research and development, and changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage
us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to address concerns
relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and
services or cause reputational harm.

Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if
we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us,
our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one
or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe
the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims,
and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be subject to
countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our
indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, on
acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one
or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements
are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a
customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.
We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws
of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United
States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication
of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a
result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may
face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for
existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and,
if approved, whether they will be enforceable.

We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations. Privacy or
security concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, or
result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.
We may process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry
standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf.
Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use

<a name="2142"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 31

of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.

In the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, became operative in 2023, and restricts the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restricts the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restricts the retention of personal information; expands the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency which can impose administrative fines for noncompliance. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have each passed their own privacy legislation which differ from the CPRA and each become effective in 2023. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.

Worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.

In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. While the European Union and United States governments have recently announced an agreement in principle on a new bilateral cross-border transfer mechanism, it is uncertain whether this agreement will be overturned in court like the previous two European Union-United States bilateral cross-border transfer agreements. These mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China, or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China, and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.

We may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example,
---
<a name="2143"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Report

<a name="2144"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 32

certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We may publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.

Data protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.

We have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors. We are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and undergoing tax audits in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.

Further, changes in tax laws may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. These include changes to U.S. tax laws and regulations, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which implements a 15% minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and parts of which became effective for us in fiscal year 2023. It is possible that these changes, or other tax law changes, could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse impacts. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD. The OECD recommended changes to long-standing tax principles and continues to develop new proposals, including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and financial condition.

Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of tax audits, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results.

Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to
---
<a name="2145"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Reports

<a name="2146"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 33

Our business. For example, we are defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. As of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.

Maintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our business.

Our ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing.

Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

# Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On May 23, 2022, our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.10 billion shares for a total cost of $17.12 billion through January 29, 2023. During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 63 million shares for $10.04 billion. As of January 29, 2023, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.23 billion through December 2023.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

In fiscal year 2023, we paid $398 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk
Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.

<a name="2163"></a>
# Overview

<a name="2164"></a>
# Our Company and Our Businesses

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC
graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for
exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific
computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.

Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics." Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April
1998.

# Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

<a name="2166"></a>
# Supply, Products Transitions, and New Products and Business Models

Our supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to
current supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand. At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase
obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. Inventory provisions for excess inventory and
purchase obligations totaled $2.17 billion in fiscal year 2023. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments
are misaligned with demand for our products.

Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel
partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are currently transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional
Visualization, and Gaming products. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners
reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue.
While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these
transitions are difficult and prior trends may not continue.

We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse
platform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can
be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases
and applications.

<a name="2167"></a>
# NVIDIA AI Cloud Service Offerings

We will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services
include NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI models, and customizable pretrained AI
models. NVIDIA has partnered with leading cloud service providers to host these services in their data centers.

We entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of fiscal year 2023 to these offerings and our research and
development activities. NVIDIA AI cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or
plan to offer standalone software solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and
several other software solutions. These new business models or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful
standalone software or as-a-service solutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these
offerings.

Global Trade

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced new license requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports
to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards
which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. We are required to transition certain operations out of China (including
Hong Kong), including research and development and supply and distribution operations. We have engaged with customers in China to
provide alternative products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new A800 offering.

Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position
may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from
competitors, or if customers develop their own internal solution, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses
to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs.

COVID-19

During fiscal year 2023, we reopened our offices worldwide. We incurred incremental expenses and related in-office costs as we ramped
onsite services.

Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment
efforts in China. During fiscal year 2023, end customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted by lockdowns
and this impact may continue if lockdowns return. COVID-19-related disruptions have created and may continue to create supply chain
and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and
regional basis.

Russia

In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and later in the year, we closed business operations in Russia. Direct sales to
Russia in fiscal year 2022 were immaterial. Our revenue to partners that sell into Russia may have been negatively impacted due to the
war in Ukraine.

Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement

In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have
acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an
acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.

Fiscal Year 2023 Summary

| |January 29, 2023|January 30, 2022|Change|

# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 38

Data Center revenue was up 41% from a year ago led by strong growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects purchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud service offerings and our research and development activities.

Gaming revenue was down 27% from a year ago reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand.

Professional Visualization revenue was down 27% from a year ago reflecting a lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels.

Automotive revenue was up 60% from a year ago reflecting growth in sales of self-driving solutions, computing solutions for electric vehicle makers and strength in sales of AI cockpit solutions. The increase also included growth in automotive development arrangements.

OEM and Other revenue was down 61% from a year ago driven by notebook OEM and CMP. CMP revenue was nominal in fiscal year 2023 and $550 million in fiscal year 2022.

Gross margin for fiscal year 2023 declined from a year ago, driven by $2.17 billion of inventory charges largely relating to excess supply of NVIDIA Ampere architecture Gaming and Data Center products as compared to the demand expectations for these products, particularly for the expected demand in China. The inventory charges were comprised of $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our demand expectations.

Operating expenses, which included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction, were up 50% from a year ago. The increase also reflected compensation, data center infrastructure, and engineering development costs.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.30 billion.

During fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.44 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023.

# Market Platform Highlights

Data Center revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $15.01 billion, up 41% from fiscal year 2022. The strong growth in Data Center revenue was influenced by hyperscaler and cloud usage of our accelerated computing platforms and networking portfolio. In Data Center, we announced the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture and began ramping the first products based on the architecture, including the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. The NVIDIA OVX server reference design launched for digital twins and other Omniverse applications. We completed two new large language models for cloud AI services — NVIDIA NeMo LLM and NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM. Additionally, we announced the NVIDIA Spectrum-4 end-to-end 400Gbps networking platform and began shipping Quantum-2 in December 2022.

Gaming revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $9.07 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022. Gaming results were influenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess inventory with our channel partners. We introduced pricing programs for our channel partners and started undershipping GPU supply to the partners so that we could lower inventory in the channel. As we exited fiscal year 2023, we have made meaningful progress in establishing lower inventory levels with our channel partners. In Gaming, we announced the new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture, and introduced the first products based on Ada, including the GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX 4070 Ti desktop GPUs and laptop GPUs featured in over 170 laptop designs. We introduced NVIDIA DLSS 3 for over 50 games and applications. We brought GeForce RTX 4080-class performance to the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier.

Professional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1.54 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022. Professional Visualization results were influenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess inventory with our OEM partners. In Professional Visualization, we added new NVIDIA Ampere architecture RTX GPUs for workstations. We also announced Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and Omniverse Cloud and released a major update to NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.

# Automotive Revenue

Automotive revenue for fiscal year 2023 grew 60% compared to fiscal year 2022 to $903 million. In Automotive, we started production of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin autonomous vehicle SOC and introduced next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Thor.

<a name="2177"></a>
# Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

<a name="2178"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.

Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.

The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% in fiscal year 2023 and 0.9% in fiscal year 2022. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. In the past, our manufacturing lead times have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.

<a name="2179"></a>
# Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling.

Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.

Price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

<a name="2182"></a>
# Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.

Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

<a name="2183"></a>
# License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="2184"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion and $907 million, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.

# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 41

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

<a name="2187"></a>
# Change in Accounting Estimate

In February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.

# Revenue by Reportable Segments

| |Year Ended|January 29, 2023|January 30, 2022|$ Change|% Change|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Compute & Networking|$15,068|$11,046|$4,022|36%| |
|Graphics|$11,906|$15,868|($3,962)|(25)%| |
|Total|$26,974|$26,914|$60|— %| |

Compute & Networking - The year-on-year increase was led by growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects purchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud service offerings and our research and development activities. The increase was also related to the growth in Automotive. CMP contributed an insignificant amount in fiscal year 2023 compared to $550 million in fiscal year 2022.

Graphics - The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand.

<a name="2193"></a>
# Concentration of Revenue

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 69% and 84% of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in revenue outside the U.S. was primarily driven by China and Taiwan related to Data Center and Gaming. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers in a different location.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.

<a name="2194"></a>
# Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.

Gross margin was 56.9% and 64.9% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $2.17 billion of inventory provisions in fiscal year 2023, which consists of approximately $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and approximately $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our current demand projections. Inventory provisions totaled $2.17 billion and $354 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off totaled $137 million and $111 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% and 0.9% in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory provisions.

Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory and related provisions and lower margins of GeForce GPUs.

The increase in research and development expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased compensation, employee growth, engineering development costs, and data center infrastructure.

The increase in sales, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased compensation and employee growth.

We recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.

|Other, net|($48)|$107|($155)|(145%)|
|Other income (expense), net|($43)|($100)|$57|(57%)|

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher yields earned on our investments.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. The increase in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion debt offering issued in June 2021.

Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Change in other, net, compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by mark-to-market losses from publicly traded equity investments and changes in value from our non-affiliated private investments. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.

We recognized income tax benefit of $187 million for fiscal year 2023 and income tax expense of $189 million for fiscal year 2022. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023 and an expense of 1.9% for fiscal year 2022.

Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years.

# Income Tax Expense

The fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate includes the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses beginning in fiscal year 2023, which resulted in a greater FDII deduction and significantly increased current taxes, with a corresponding deferred tax benefit at the relevant statutory tax rate.

The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to increased tax benefits of the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to lower profitability. This is partially offset by the impact of an increase in the proportion of earnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time benefits of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary in fiscal year 2022, or the Domestication.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

| |January 29, 2023|January 30, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Cash and cash equivalents|$3,389|$1,990|
|Marketable securities|$9,907|$19,218|
|Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities|$13,296|$21,208|

| |Year Ended January 29, 2023|Year Ended January 30, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Net cash provided by operating activities|$5,641|$9,108|
|Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities|$7,375|$(9,830)|
|Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities|$(11,617)|$1,865|

As of January 29, 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $7.91 billion from the end of fiscal year 2022. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to a decrease in net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the Arm acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion, and higher tax payments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by lower accounts receivable due to strong collections partially offset by timing of supplier payments and inventory deliveries.

Cash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by lower purchases and higher sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by higher capital expenditures.

Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, due to share repurchases and the absence of debt issuance proceeds in fiscal year 2023, offset by absence of debt repayment.

<a name="2206"></a>
# Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and cash generated by our operations. At the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.25 billion of debt repayment due in fiscal year 2024. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.

Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

During fiscal year 2024, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.10 billion to $1.30 billion related to property and equipment. Except for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. at the end of fiscal year 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.

Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. The adverse cash flow impact of mandatory capitalization will be reduced in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

# Capital Return to Shareholders

During fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.04 billion in share repurchases and $398 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. As of January 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.23 billion through December 2023.

# Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations

For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.

We have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.02 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $95 million, recorded in non-current income tax payable at the end of fiscal year 2023. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

# Investment and Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.

As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $17 million.

As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of

# Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United States dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.

Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The primary currency we hedge is Israeli Shekel.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.

We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $112 million and $103 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.

If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $36 million and $41 million as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.

# Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on their evaluation as of January 29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2023.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 29, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we completed the consolidated financial reporting phase of the implementation, which included updating our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
---
<a name="2242"></a>
# # NVIDIA Corporation Quarterly Report

<a name="2243"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 53

Directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<a name="2244"></a>
# Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

<a name="2245"></a>
# Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments

As described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 29, 2023, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159 million and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.

# Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our Company

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were both 52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Prior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 7 have been adjusted to write off immaterial fully amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

...

Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are

<a name="2274"></a>
# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES - NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<a name="2275"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 60

Sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.

Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

<a name="2276"></a>
# License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

<a name="2277"></a>
# Software Licensing

Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.

<a name="2278"></a>
# Cloud Services

Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.

<a name="2279"></a>
# Product Warranties

We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

<a name="2280"></a>
# Stock-based Compensation

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line.

<a name="2283"></a>
# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<a name="2284"></a>
# attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated
amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the
Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for
our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical
experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings,
involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes,
goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or
investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines
and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of
our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events,
we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially
different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and
equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect
during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical
exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income
and to date have not been significant.

Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current
fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of
future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax
assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties
in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty
or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we
operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income
tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment
of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an
income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other
deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income,
including capital gains, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired
as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would
recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

<a name="2289"></a>
# Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.

<a name="2290"></a>
# Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.

We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

<a name="2291"></a>
# Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

<a name="2292"></a>
# Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount

# Fiscal Year 2023, Page 63

Identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.

<a name="2297"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.

<a name="2298"></a>
# Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

<a name="2299"></a>
# Leases

We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.

# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.

Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.

The quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.

Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

Business Combination

We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.

Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities

Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee.

Marketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net.

# Note 4 - Stock-Based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our ESPP.

Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows:

**Stock-Based Compensation Expense**
| |Year Ended|January 29, 2023|January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|

|Total|$|2,710|2,004|1,397|

Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021.

The following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans:

**Equity Awards Summary**
| |Year Ended|January 29, 2023|January 30, 2022|January 31, 2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs| |25|18|36|
|Estimated total grant-date fair value|$|4,505|3,492|2,764|
|Weighted average grant-date fair value per share|$|183.72|190.69|76.81|

**ESPP Summary**

The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:

| |Year Ended January 29, 2023|Year Ended January 30, 2022|Year Ended January 31, 2021|
|---|---|---|---|
|ESPP| | | |
|Weighted average expected life (in years)|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|
|Risk-free interest rate|—%-4.6%|—%-0.5%|0.1%-1.6%|
|Volatility|43%-72%|20%-58%|26%-89%|
|Dividend yield|0.1%|0.1%|0.1%-0.3%|

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase
date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury
bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using
historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU
awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs
are discounted for the dividend yield.

Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of
forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on
historical experience.

Equity Incentive Program

We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity
incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based
awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.

Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated,
or the 2007 Plan.

The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to
employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 29, 2023, up to
47 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 2
million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All options are fully vested, the last of which
will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan,
under which, as of January 29, 2023, there were 160 million shares available for future grants.

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with
25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly
thereafter, (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is
close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C) over a four-year period, subject to
continued service, with 6.25% vesting quarterly. PSUs vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25%
vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter.
Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares
subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee
based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.

# Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and
restated, or the 2012 Plan.

Employees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The
Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into
four purchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the
fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock
on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 29, 2023, we had 230 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012
Plan.

# Equity Award Activity

The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:

| |Number of Shares|Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value|

|Balances, January 29, 2023|45 million|$158.45|
|Vested and expected to vest after January 29, 2023|45 million|$158.35|

As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, there were 160 million and 131 million shares, respectively, of common stock available for
future grants under our equity incentive plans.

As of January 29, 2023, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $410 million, with an average
exercise price of $3.79 per share and an average remaining term of 0.5 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was
$642 million, $741 million, and $521 million for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Upon the exercise of an option, we issue
a new share of stock.

The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 29, 2023, January 30, 2022,
and January 31, 2021, was $4.27 billion, $5.56 billion, and $2.67 billion, respectively.

# Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our
operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on
the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the
related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not
significant as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge
accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and
offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also
recorded in other income or expense.

**Notional Value of Foreign Currency Forward Contracts**
| |January 29, 2023|January 30, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Designated as cash flow hedges|$1,128 million|$1,023 million|
|Non-designated hedges|$366 million|$408 million|

As of January 29, 2023, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized
gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts
within the next twelve months was not significant.

During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on
other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

As of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations totaling $4.92 billion, inclusive of the $810 million. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers, subcontractors and contract manufacturers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but may result in the payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Other non-inventory purchase obligations of $3.14 billion include $2.23 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements.

including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 10, 2022.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.

The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies

As of January 29, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

(1) Capitalized research and development deferred tax assets were previously included in Property, equipment and intangible assets.

(2) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $3.40 billion and $1.22 billion and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $247 million and $245 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of January 29, 2023, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.05 billion and $245 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion and $907 million, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.

As of January 29, 2023, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $363 million, $329 million and $329 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years 2026 and 2024, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $329 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 29, 2023, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $26 million, before the impact of uncertain tax positions, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2024. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.49 billion, before the impact of uncertain tax positions. $1.41 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely and $83 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2024. As of January 29, 2023, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of $1.38 billion that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2024.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 29, 2023 are $770 million of tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.

We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.

We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We recognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense line of our consolidated statements of income of $33 million, $14 million, and $7 million during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, we have accrued $95 million and $59 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 29, 2023, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 29, 2023, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2022. As of January 29, 2023, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany, India, Israel, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2022.

During fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, we paid $398 million, $399 million, and $395 million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

In fiscal year 2022, we retired our existing 349 million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $20 million and retained earnings by $12.0 billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares.

<a name="2397"></a>
# Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans

We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $227 million, $168 million, and $120 million, respectively.

<a name="2398"></a>
# Note 17 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance.

The Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and CMP.

The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating metaverse and 3D internet applications.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, corporate infrastructure and support costs, restructuring costs, acquisition termination cost, IP-related and legal settlement costs, contributions, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

# Government Regulations

Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.

In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products.

Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East.

While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.

Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods.

# Climate Change

In the area of environmental sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.

In May 2023, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year 2024 metrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2025. There has been no material impact to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase

or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers. In fiscal year 2023, we increased the
percentage of our total electricity use matched by renewable energy purchases to 44%. By fiscal year 2026, we aim to engage manufacturing suppliers
comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.

Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy
efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-accelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than
traditional computing for many workloads because it is optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency
of our products is evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 24 of the top 30
most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the Green500 list.

We plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy
makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.

<a name="2473"></a>
# Human Capital Management

We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of fiscal
year 2024, we had approximately 29,600 employees in 36 countries, 22,200 were engaged in research and development and 7,400 were engaged in
sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies
and strategies relating to human capital management.

To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified
executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.

<a name="2474"></a>
# Recruitment

As the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in attracting
top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent globally through our strong employer brand and differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional,
and leadership talent. Our workforce is 83% technical and 49% hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased focus on diversity recruiting,
resulting in an increase in global female hiring in each channel. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 40% of our new hires in fiscal
year 2024 coming from employee referrals.

<a name="2475"></a>
# Development and Retention

To support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted development programs, mentoring
and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions,
and speaker forums. We create learning paths focused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that
our employees are exposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational
programs and advanced certifications. We implemented a career coaching service to provide one-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage
internal job mobility. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally
underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.

To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys
help us gain insight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that we can take targeted action. The suggestion box is an
always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform
is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.

We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In fiscal year 2024, our
overall turnover rate was 2.7%.

<a name="2476"></a>
# Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being

Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive equity,
except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously
aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.

We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and financial health. Programs include 401(k)
programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and
time off policies to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide
comparable support across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on the needs of our Community
Resource Groups and continuing our support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become parents.

# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 12

Our support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing team of world-class talent and their families.

<a name="2479"></a>
# Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging

We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees.

When recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.

To this end, we have been:

- Partnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;
- Embedding dedicated recruiting teams to business areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and find internal opportunities;
- Supporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;
- Providing peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;
- Providing training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for diversity;
- Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and
- Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.

As of the end of fiscal year 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.

<a name="2480"></a>
# Flexible Working Environment

We support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under certain conditions. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work.

During fiscal year 2025, we will continue to have a flexible work environment and maintain our company-wide 2-days off a quarter for employees to rest and recharge.

• develop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;

• launch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as software-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;

• expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;

• meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance standards;

• manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction;

• develop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and

• complete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities.

We have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed.

We have begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services directly and through our network of partners, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX Cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and several other software solutions. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.

Competition could adversely impact our market share and financial results. Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.

Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing Failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient

<a name="2501"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 16

Commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.

Many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:

- Changes in product development cycles and time to market;
- Competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;
- Changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;
- Sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;
- Rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
- The availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;
- New product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;
- New or unexpected end-use cases;
- Increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;
- Business decisions made by third parties;
- The demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX Cloud services;
- Changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
- The demand for our products; or
- Government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.

Demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.

Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate

<a name="2502"></a>
# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Reports

<a name="2503"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 17

Transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.

Many end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.

If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.

If we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.

We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.

Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.

The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our

# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 18

GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.

Additionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.

Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. We face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:

- lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;
- failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
- failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;
- failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;
- limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers and memory manufacturers;
- loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;
- lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;
- suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;
- delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;
- requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;
- low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology; and
- disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes, fires, or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts.

Defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause us to lose market share. Our hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software products we or our partners offer rely on

training data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and
errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement,
we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services
have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in
our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and
deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead
to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1
automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement
costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management
personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to
our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in
failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships
with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business
operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs
to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.

For example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and
other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in
future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately
recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product
liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as
within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and
harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could
adversely impact our financial results.

# Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business

Adverse economic conditions may harm our business.
Economic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade
policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by
businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply
chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on
our business and financial results, including:

- increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the
past and may do so in the future;
- increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future
reduce our margins;
- decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;
- the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to
customers and/or end users;
- limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;
- the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing parties or other third parties
we rely on;
- reduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for bankruptcy protection and
potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect
our ability to compete effectively; and
- increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts
on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the
value of our financial instruments.

Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions, which could impact our customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligations.

Additionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio comprises USG securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.

International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business. We sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 56% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024. Although we have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China, we have started to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing requirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.

Product, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation. Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.

Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.

Individuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally, some actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. We may also incorporate third-party data into our AI algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our algorithms. These datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents. We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the past), it could result in a security incident for us.

past and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and
other information related to the security incident. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a
result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential
liability and harm our business.

To defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is
expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness
initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of
our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and
take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate
all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change
frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial
measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these
vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.

We hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security
measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about
us or third parties, could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent
liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold
proprietary game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past,
could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and
liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security
incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight,
restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial
loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services,
and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect
our financial results, stock price and reputation. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including
affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative
publicity. In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data
brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our business.

Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications
failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics,
abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our
current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations,
finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes,
wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who
provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our business continuity and disaster recovery
planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase
economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in
which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but
not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are
concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product
demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business
with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by
economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any
reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures or cyber-attacks,
military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and
other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us,
the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and
substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and
operating results.

We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.

Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.

Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Our business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.

We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.

We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been.

# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 23

harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.

Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:

- difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;
- assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
- integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
- coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;
- stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;
- potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;
- the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
- the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;
- negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;
- exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and
- impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.

For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.

We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.

We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners. One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the
---

# # Nvidia Corporation Quarterly Report Extract

<a name="2520"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 24

Compute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop capable and diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.

Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls. We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.

Identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:

- our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
- our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;
- our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs;
- our vendors' payment requirements;
- unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and
- changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.

Any of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility.

Fiscal Year 2024, Page 25

Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.

We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.

Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. If implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.

Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.

For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.

The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.

Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.

Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated

<a name="2525"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 26

products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in
scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China,
and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability
to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and
semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export
our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and
negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may
in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting
our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and
could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.

Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside
China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand
for our products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules
are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.

Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively
impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related
supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of
our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact
our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain
or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators
in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our
Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could
be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our
business, operating results and financial condition.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor
and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to
develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100
integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to
any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board
that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for
certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing
requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.

In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports
to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of
our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements
also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in,
Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments
of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.

Following these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of
China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and
distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer
new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer
requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming.
We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a
license is offered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating
license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or
“NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has
been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and
already have disadvantaged and may in the future

<a name="2527"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 27

disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses
for their products.
Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our
competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including
further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop
their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in
a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses,
the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing
requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more
cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in
China, Europe, and Israel.

Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules
at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and
financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement
products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets,
including the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service
large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip
tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed
export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant
portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export
controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong.
Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing
our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a
disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.
Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to “design-out”
certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide.
Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers
purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive
or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin
America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by
the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may
increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.

Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose
restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example,
the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours.
Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new
restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and
financial results.

Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs
or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.
Shareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and government regulators have focused
increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may
not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there is an increasing number of state-
level initiatives in the U.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. Additionally, our corporate
sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder.

Regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.

Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability. Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in response to the Biden administration’s Executive Order on AI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify the USG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.

Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. We may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.

We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.

We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. These areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability. We process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard

Fiscal Year 2024, Page 29

The protection of personal data and compliance with data privacy and security laws are critical for Nvidia Corporation. Failure to adhere to these regulations could have severe consequences on the company's reputation and financial performance. Below are some key points extracted from the report:

<a name="2532"></a>
# United States Data Privacy Laws

In the United States, various federal, state, and local laws govern data privacy and security. States like California have enacted comprehensive privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which grant residents specific rights regarding their personal data. Non-compliance with these laws can lead to significant fines and legal actions.

<a name="2533"></a>
# European Union Data Protection Regulations

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK's GDPR impose strict rules on handling personal data within the European Economic Area. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in substantial penalties based on a percentage of global revenue.

<a name="2534"></a>
# Cross-Border Data Transfers

Nvidia Corporation transfers personal data across various jurisdictions, including Europe, China, and the United States. Different regions have enacted laws restricting cross-border data transfers, leading to increased complexity and potential fines for non-compliance.

<a name="2535"></a>
# Contractual Obligations and Compliance Efforts

The company is also bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security. Compliance with laws like GDPR and CCPA requires Nvidia to ensure that its customers impose specific restrictions on data handling. Failure to meet these obligations can result in damaged customer relationships and legal consequences.

It is crucial for Nvidia Corporation to continuously monitor and adapt to evolving data privacy and security regulations to mitigate risks and maintain trust with customers and stakeholders.

Data protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.

We are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.

Further, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Pillar Two Model Rules announced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.

Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. As of January 28, 2024, we had net outstanding a total of $9.7 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program. Maintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our business.

Our ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared

immediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain
future financing and affect the terms of any such financing.
Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.
The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Provisions in our certificate
of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the
ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without
prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director
nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft
may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy
contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

# Risk management and strategy

We have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively address circumstances that
arise when unexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These include processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks
from cybersecurity threats. Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001
international standard for Information Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such
as cybersecurity firms and risk management and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.
Identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place
cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond
to, mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.

We also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate
cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other sensitive company information.
We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks
associated with these vendors. We routinely assess our high-risk suppliers’ conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-
TPAT), and we evaluate them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements.
Refer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information about cybersecurity-related risks.

<a name="2544"></a>
# Governance

Information security matters, including managing and assessing risks from cybersecurity threats, remain under the oversight of the Company’s Board
of Directors, or the Board. The Audit Committee of the Board, or the Audit Committee, also reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s
information security policies and practices and the internal controls regarding information security risks. The Audit Committee receives regular information
security updates from management, including our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team. The Board also receives annual reports on
information security matters from our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team.

Our security efforts are managed by a team of executive cybersecurity, IT, engineering, operations, and legal professionals. We have established a cross-
functional leadership team, consisting of executive-level leaders, that meets regularly to review cybersecurity matters and evaluate emerging threats.
With oversight and guidance provided by the cross-functional leadership team, our information security teams refine our practices to address emerging
security risks and changes in regulations. Our executive-level leadership team also participates in cybersecurity incident response efforts by engaging
with the incident response team and helping direct the company’s response to and assessment of certain cybersecurity incidents.

We have designated a Chief Security Officer that reports to our Senior Vice President of Software Engineering to manage our assessment and
management of material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Chief Security Officer’s cybersecurity expertise includes over 17 years of combined
government and private sector assignments.

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 16, 2024, we had approximately 382 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.0 billion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for $9.7 billion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $22.5 billion.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

In fiscal year 2024, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

<a name="2555"></a>
# Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models

Demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.

We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity.

Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.

We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.

# Global Trade

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.

In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.

We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing requirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.

Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East.

While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.

<a name="2559"></a>
# Macroeconomic Factors

Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.

<a name="2560"></a>
# Israel and Hamas Conflict

We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.

Electric vehicles, and announced further adoption of NVIDIA DRIVE platform with BYD, XPENG, GWM, Li Auto, ZEEKR and Xiaomi.

<a name="2572"></a>
# Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.

<a name="2573"></a>
# Inventories

We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.

Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.

The net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024 and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.

<a name="2574"></a>
# Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

<a name="2577"></a>
# Revenue Recognition

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.

We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.

<a name="2578"></a>
# License and Development Arrangements

Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.

<a name="2579"></a>
# Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.

<a name="2580"></a>
# Change in Accounting Estimate

In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.

All Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024.

Concentration of Revenue

Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises and gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Our direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public sector entities, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, AIB, and distributors.

Sales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.

Our estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated. There were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.

Our overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023. The year over year increase was primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.

Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for both fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $540 million and $137 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 7.5% in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Operating Expenses

| |Year Ended Jan 28, 2024|Year Ended Jan 29, 2023|Change ($ in millions)|Change (%)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Research and development expenses|$8,675|$7,339|$1,336|18%|
|Sales, general and administrative expenses|$2,654|$2,440|$214|9%|
|Acquisition termination cost|$0|$1,353|($1,353)|(100%)|
|Total operating expenses|$11,329|$11,132|$197|2%|

The increase in research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2024 was primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.

Acquisition Termination Cost

We recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.

# Other Income (Expense), Net

|Other, net| |237|(48)|285|
|Other income (expense), net| |$846|($43)|$889|

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The increase in interest income was due to higher yields on higher cash balances.

Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.

Other, net, consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Change in Other, net, compared to fiscal year 2023 was driven by changes in value from our non-affiliated investments. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.

# Income Taxes

We recognized income tax expense of $4.1 billion for fiscal year 2024 and income tax benefit of $187 million for fiscal year 2023. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 12.0% for fiscal year 2024 and a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was resolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related to this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled positions. This benefit consists of a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit, partially offset by additional cash tax payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.

The effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.

Our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit resolution.

# OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting

The OECD has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules for a new 15% global minimum tax applicable to large multinational corporations. Certain jurisdictions, including European Union member states and the United Kingdom, have enacted Pillar Two legislation that will start to become effective for our fiscal year 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation on Pillar Two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global implementation of these rules. Based on enacted laws, Pillar Two is not expected to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year. New legislation or guidance could change our current assessment.

|Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities|$(10,566)|$7,375|
|Net cash used in financing activities|$(13,633)|$(11,617)|

Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to growth in revenue. Accounts receivable balance in fiscal year 2024 reflected $557 million from customer payments received ahead of the invoice due date.

Cash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily driven by lower marketable securities maturities and higher purchases of marketable securities. Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to a debt repayment and higher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share repurchases.

<a name="2599"></a>
# Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. At the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $26.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.3 billion of debt repayment due in fiscal year 2025 and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.

Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

During fiscal year 2025, we expect to use our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion related to property and equipment.

Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. at the end of fiscal year 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.

<a name="2600"></a>
# Capital Return to Shareholders

During fiscal year 2024, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends.

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.0 billion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for $9.7 billion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock.

# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 43

Common stock up to $22.5 billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $1.9 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022 which was not material for fiscal year 2024.

We have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.3 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $140 million, recorded in non-current income tax payable at the end of fiscal year 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

# Investment and Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and growth of our businesses. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for these investments of $93 million.

As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $9.7 billion of senior Notes net outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no

# Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

The company considers direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations minimal due to sales in United States dollars and the use of foreign currency forward contracts to offset movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss on net income was not significant for fiscal years 2024 and 2023.

Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers are in United States dollars, reducing exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could impact product pricing and manufacturing costs.

If the U.S. dollar had strengthened by 10% as of January 28, 2024, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income related to foreign exchange contracts would have been $116 million lower. A similar scenario for January 29, 2023, would have resulted in a $112 million decrease.

An adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change on balance sheet hedging contracts would have impacted income before taxes by $60 million as of January 28, 2024, and $36 million as of January 29, 2023.

Existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

Item 9B. Other Information

On December 18, 2023, John O. Dabiri, a member of our Board of Directors, adopted a trading arrangement that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale through December 2, 2024 of an estimated 553 shares of our common stock, assuming our closing stock price as of January 26, 2024. The number of shares is based on an estimate because the plan specifies a formulaic dollar amount of shares to be sold.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 28, 2024 and
January 29, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 28, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28,
2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

<a name="2630"></a>
# Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

<a name="2631"></a>
# Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 49

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

<a name="2634"></a>
# Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments

As described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.

# Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our Company

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to seven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.

Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through specific steps outlined.

Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Details on support, extended warranty, returns, and customer programs are provided.

# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 56

License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

Software Licensing

Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.

Cloud Services

Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.

Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.

Product Warranties

We offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Stock-based Compensation

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.

Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs

We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions

<a name="2668"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 57

or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes
available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably
estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation
or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

<a name="2669"></a>
# Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States
dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical
exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-
monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included
in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.

<a name="2670"></a>
# Income Taxes

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by
tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable
to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits
that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application
of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated
outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.

In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current
assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

As of January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets
that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the
extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during
the period.

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical
merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

<a name="2671"></a>
# Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock
method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.

<a name="2672"></a>
# Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase
to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We
currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.

We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-
sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss,
a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on
the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less
than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the
securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or

<a name="2675"></a>
# Fiscal Year 2024, Page 58

We intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

<a name="2676"></a>
# Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

<a name="2677"></a>
# Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.

<a name="2678"></a>
# Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.

<a name="2679"></a>
# Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

<a name="2680"></a>
# Leases

We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.

# Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.

Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. The quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.

<a name="2686"></a>
# Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

<a name="2687"></a>
# Business Combination

We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.

<a name="2688"></a>
# Investments in Non-Affiliated Entities

Our investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do not have readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

# Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide for additional disclosures about significant expenses in operating segments. The standard is effective for our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and for interim period reporting starting in fiscal year 2026 retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides for new and changes to income tax disclosures including disaggregation of the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. The amendments in the standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in our annual period beginning fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

# Note 2 - Business Combination

Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement

In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.

<a name="2695"></a>
# Note 3 - Leases

Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2025 and 2035.

Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 28, 2024, are as follows:

The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:

| |Year Ended Jan 28, 2024|Year Ended Jan 29, 2023|Year Ended Jan 30, 2022|
|---|---|---|---|
|ESPP|(Using the Black-Scholes model)| | |
|Weighted average expected life (in years)|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|0.1-2.0|
|Risk-free interest rate|3.9%-5.5%|—%-4.6%|—%-0.5%|
|Volatility|31%-67%|43%-72%|20%-58%|
|Dividend yield|0.1%|0.1%|0.1%|

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.

Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.

<a name="2705"></a>
# Equity Incentive Program

We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.

<a name="2706"></a>
# Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 28, 2024, up to 37 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 28, 2024, there were 147 million shares available for future grants.

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 6.25% vesting quarterly. PSUs vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on about the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.

<a name="2707"></a>
# Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan. Employees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is about 24 months, divided into four purchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 28, 2024, we had 227 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

# Equity Award Activity

The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:

|RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding|Number of Shares|Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value|
|---|---|---|
|Balances, Jan 29, 2023|45 million|$158.45|
|Granted|14 million|$374.08|
|Vested restricted stock|(21) million|$148.56|
|Canceled and forfeited|(1) million|$206.35|
|Balances, Jan 28, 2024|37 million|$245.94|
|Vested and expected to vest after Jan 28, 2024|37 million|$245.49|

As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, there were 147 million and 160 million shares, respectively, of common stock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.

The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 28, 2024, January 29, 2023, and January 30, 2022, was $8.2 billion, $4.3 billion, and $5.6 billion, respectively.

# Net Income Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

| |Jan 28, 2024|Jan 29, 2023|Jan 30, 2022|
|---|---|---|---|
|Numerator: Net income|$29,760 million|$4,368 million|$9,752 million|
|Basic weighted average shares|2,469 million|2,487 million|2,496 million|
|Dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards|25 million|20 million|39 million|
|Diluted weighted average shares|2,494 million|2,507 million|2,535 million|
|Net income per share: Basic (1)|$12.05|$1.76|$3.91|
|Net income per share: Diluted (2)|$11.93|$1.74|$3.85|

Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive: 15 million (2024), 40 million (2023), 21 million (2022).

<a name="2714"></a>
# Goodwill

As of January 28, 2024, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.4 billion, consisting of goodwill balances allocated to our Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units of $4.1 billion and $370 million, respectively. Goodwill increased by $59 million in fiscal year 2024 from an immaterial acquisition and was allocated to our Compute & Networking reporting unit. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, we completed our annual qualitative impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.

Investments in Non-Affiliated Entities

Our investments in non-affiliated entities include marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. Our marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values and are recorded as long-term other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Other income and expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Marketable equity securities totaled $225 million and $11 million as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, respectively. The net unrealized and realized gains and losses of investments in marketable securities net were not significant for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Our non-marketable equity securities are recorded in long-term other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities totaled $1.3 billion and $288 million as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, respectively. Gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in Other income and expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These
contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness
should occur.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the
change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

**Notional Value of Foreign Currency Forward Contracts**
| |Jan 28, 2024|Jan 29, 2023|
|---|---|---|
|Designated as cash flow hedges|$1,168|$1,128|
|Non-designated hedges|$597|$366|

The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was not significant as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023.

As of January 28, 2024, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.

During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive
income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

# Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Obligations

Our purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including long-term supply and capacity
agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets.

As of January 28, 2024, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $16.1 billion. We enter into
agreements with contract manufacturers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us, and in certain instances, these
agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, but
these changes may result in the payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $4.6 billion,
which includes $3.5 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements, primarily to support our research and development efforts.

Resolution of Legal Matters:

On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate. NVIDIA’s deadline to file a petition for a writ of certiorari is March 4, 2024.

Derivative Lawsuits:

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.

Following the Ninth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties are conferring regarding the next steps in this derivative matter.

The lawsuit asserts claims against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM).

This lawsuit asserts claims against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies:

As of January 28, 2024, no accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above has been recorded based on the belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable.

Any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business, and we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity, or financial position.

The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:

| |Jan 28, 2024|Jan 29, 2023|
|---|---|---|
|Deferred tax assets:| | |
|Capitalized research and development expenditure|$3,376|$1,859|
|GILTI deferred tax assets|1,576|800|
|Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes|1,121|686|
|Research and other tax credit carryforwards|936|951|
|Net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards|439|409|
|Operating lease liabilities|263|193|
|Stock-based compensation|106|99|
|Property, equipment and intangible assets|4|66|
|Other deferred tax assets|179|91|
|Gross deferred tax assets|8,000|5,154|
|Less valuation allowance|(1,552)|(1,484)|
|Total deferred tax assets|6,448|3,670|
|Deferred tax liabilities:| | |
|Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries|(502)|(228)|
|Operating lease assets|(255)|(179)|
|Acquired intangibles|(74)|(115)|
|Gross deferred tax liabilities|(831)|(522)|
|Net deferred tax asset (1)|$5,617|$3,148|

(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $6.1 billion and $3.4 billion and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $462 million and $247 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of January 28, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.1 billion and $250 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.

As of January 28, 2024, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $315 million, $342 million and $361 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $361 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $31 million, before the impact of uncertain tax positions, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.6 billion, before the impact of uncertain tax positions. $1.5 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely and $75 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of $1.4 billion that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025.

Our tax attributes remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of tax attributes may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the tax attributes may expire or be denied before utilization.

A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

| |Jan 28, 2024|Jan 29, 2023|Jan 30, 2022|
|---|---|---|---|
|Balance at beginning of period|$1,238|$1,013|$776|
|Increases in tax positions for current year|616|268|246|
|Increases in tax positions for prior years|87|1|14|
|Decreases in tax positions for prior years|(148)|(15)|(4)|
|Settlements|(104)|(9)|(8)|
|Lapse in statute of limitations|(19)|(20)|(11)|
|Balance at end of period|$1,670|$1,238|$1,013|

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 28, 2024 are $1.0 billion of tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.

We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $42 million, $33 million, and $14 million during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we have accrued $140 million and $95 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Our provisions on federal, state, and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 28, 2024, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. Significant tax jurisdictions subject to examination include the United States for fiscal years after 2020, as well as China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom for fiscal years 2005 through 2023. Currently under examination are Germany, India, Israel, and Taiwan for fiscal years 2005 through 2023.

# Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity

Capital Return Program

In August 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program of an additional $25.0 billion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, 21 million shares of common stock were repurchased for $9.7 billion. As of January 28, 2024, authorization was in place to repurchase additional shares up to $22.5 billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, 2.8 million shares were repurchased for $1.9 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. The share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees.

Cash dividends of $395 million, $398 million, and $399 million were paid to shareholders during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The cash dividend program and future payments are subject to the Board of Directors' determination.

In fiscal year 2022, 349 million treasury shares were retired, assuming the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $20 million and retained earnings by $12.0 billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares.

# Note 17 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance.

The Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive artificial intelligence, or AI, Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and DGX Cloud.

The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating 3D internet applications.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, intellectual property related, or IP-related costs, acquisition termination cost, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, our CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

| |Compute & Networking|Graphics|All Other|Consolidated|

|Other countries|$10,245|$5,911|$6,910|
|Total Revenue|$60,922|$26,974|$26,914|

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 56%, 69%, and 84% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in revenue to the United States for fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand.

Sales to one customer represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.
